Chermak emphasized the importance of formally establishing a partnership structure so that when local union and contractor officials change, the partnership program remains.


Two men in a smoking-room were talking of their private-school days. "At our
school" said  "we had a ghost's footmark on the staircase. "

  " What was it like"

  "Oh, very unconvincing. Just the shape of a shoe, with a square toe, if I
remember right. The staircase was a stone one. I never heard any story about
the thing. That seems odd, when you come to think of it. Why didn't somebody
invent one, I wonder"

  "You never can tell with little boys. They have a mythology of their own.
There's a subject for you, by the way - "The Folklore of Private Schools"

  "Yes; the crop is rather scanty, though. I imagine, if you were to
investigate the cycle of ghost stories, for instance, which the boys at
private schools tell each other, they would all turn out to be
highly-compressed versions of stories out of books"

  "Nowadays the Strand and Pearson's, and so on, would be extensively drawn
upon"

  "No doubt: they weren't born or thought of in my time. Let's see. I
wonder if I can remember the staple ones that I was told. First, there was
the house with a room in which a series of people insisted on passing a
night; and each of them in the morning was found kneeling in a corner, and
had just time to say, 'I seen it' and died"

  "Wasn't that the house in Berkeley Square"

  "I dare say it was. Then there was the man who heard a noise in the
passage at night, opened his door, and saw someone crawling towards him on
all fours with his eye hanging out on his cheek. There was besides, let me
think - Yes! the room where a man was found dead in bed with a horseshoe
mark on his forehead, and the floor under the bed was covered with marks of
horseshoes also; I don't know why. Also there was the lady who, on locking
her bedroom door in a strange house, heard a thin voice among the
bed-curtains say, 'Now we're shut in for the night' None of those had any
explanation or sequel. I wonder if they go on still, those stories"

  "Oh, likely enough - with additions from the magazines, as I said. You
never heard, did you, of a real ghost at a private school? I thought not,
nobody has that ever I came across"

  "From the way in which you said that, I gather that you have"

  "I really don't know, but this is what was in my mind. It happened at my
private school thirty odd years ago, and I haven't any explanation of it.

  "The school I mean was near London. It was established in a large and
fairly old house - a great white building with very fine grounds about it;
there were large cedars in the garden, as there are in so many of the older
gardens in the Thames valley, and ancient elms in the three or four fields
which we used for our games. I think probably it was quite an attractive
place, but boys seldom allow that their schools possess any tolerable
features.

  "I came to the school in a September, soon after the year  and among
the boys who arrived on the same day was one whom I took to: a Highland boy,
whom I will call McLeod. I needn't spend time in describing him: the main
thing is that I got to know him very well. He was not an exceptional boy in
any way - not particularly good at books or games - but he suited me.

  "The school was a large one: there must have been from  boys
there as a rule, and so a considerable staff of masters was required, and
there were rather frequent changes among them.

  "One term - perhaps it was my third or fourth - a new master made his
appearance. His name was Sampson. He was a tallish, stoutish, pale,
black-bearded man. I think we liked him: he had travelled a good deal, and
had stories which amused us on our school walks, so that there was some
competition among us to get within earshot of him. I remember too - dear me,
I have hardly thought of it since then - that he had a charm on his
watch-chain that attracted my attention one day, and he let me examine it.
It was, I now suppose, a gold Byzantine coin; there was an effigy of some
absurd emperor on one side; the other side had been worn practically smooth,
and he had had cut on it - rather barbarously - his own initials,	
and a date, 24 July,  Yes, I can see it now: he told me he had picked
it up in Constantinople: it was about the size of a florin, perhaps rather
smaller.

  "Well, the first odd thing that happened was this. Sampson was doing
Latin grammar with us. One of his favourite methods - perhaps it is rather a
good one - was to make us construct sentences out of our own heads to
illustrate the rules he was trying to make us learn. Of course that is a
thing which gives a silly boy a chance of being impertinent: there are lots
of school stories in which that happens - or any-how there might be. But
Sampson was too good a disciplinarian for us to think of trying that on with
him. Now, on this occasion he was telling us how to express remembering in
Latin: and he ordered us each to make a sentence bringing in the verb
memini, 'I remember' Well, most of us made up some ordinary sentence such
as 'I remember my father, or 'He remembers his book' or something equally
uninteresting: and I dare say a good many put down memino librum meum, and
so forth: but the boy I mentioned - McLeod - was evidently thinking of
something more elaborate than that. The rest of us wanted to have our
sentences passed, and get on to something else, so some kicked him under the
desk, and I, who was next to him, poked him and whispered to him to look
sharp. But he didn't seem to attend. I looked at his paper and saw he had
put down nothing at all. So I jogged him again harder than before and
upbraided him sharply for keeping us all waiting. That did have some effect.
He started and seemed to wake up, and then very quickly he scribbled about a
couple of lines on his paper, and showed it up with the rest. As it was the
last, or nearly the last, to come in, and as Sampson had a good deal to say
to the boys who had written meminiscimus patri meo and the rest of it, it
turned out that the clock struck twelve before he had got to McLeod, and
McLeod had to wait afterwards to have his sentence corrected. There was
nothing much going on outside when I got out, so I waited for him to come.
He came very slowly when he did arrive, and I guessed there had been some
sort of trouble. 'Well,' I said, 'what did you get' 'Oh, I don't know'
said McLeod, 'nothing much: but I think Sampson's rather sick with me'
'Why, did you show him up some rot' 'No fear' he said. 'It was all right
as far as I could see: it was like this: Memento - that's right enough for
remember, and it takes a genitive, - memento putei inter quatuor taxos.'
'What silly rot' I said. 'What made you shove that down? What does it
mean' 'That's the funny part' said McLeod. not quite sure what it
does mean. All I know is, it just came into my head and I corked it down. I
know what I think it means, because just before I wrote it down I had a sort
of picture of it in my head: I believe it means "Remember the well among the
four" - what are those dark sort of trees that have red berries on them'
'Mountain ashes, I pose you mean' 'I never heard of them' said McLeod;
'no, I'll tell you - yews' 'Well, and what did Sampson say? 'Why, he was
jolly odd about it. When he read it he got up and went to the mantel-piece
and stopped quite a long time without saying anything, with his back to me.
And then he said, without turning round, and rather quiet, "What do you
suppose that means? I told him what I thought; only I couldn't remember the
name of the silly tree: and then he wanted to know why I put it down, and I
had to say something or other. And after that he left off talking about it,
and asked me how long I'd been here, and where my people lived, and things
like that: and then I came away: but he wasn't looking a bit well'

  "I don't remember any more that was said by either of us about this. Next
day McLeod took to his bed with a chill or something of the kind, and it was
a week or more before he was in school again. And as much as a month went by
without anything happening that was noticeable. Whether or not Mr. Sampson
was really startled, as McLeod had thought, he didn't show it. I am pretty
sure, of course, now, that there was something very curious in his past
history, but I'm not going to pretend that we boys were sharp enough to
guess any such thing.

  "There was one other incident of the same kind as the last which I told
you. Several times since that day we had had to make up examples in school
to illustrate different rules, but there had never been any row except when
we did them wrong. At last there came a day when we were going through those
dismal things which people call Conditional Sentences, and we were told to
make a conditional sentence, expressing a future consequence. We did it,
right or wrong, and showed up our bits of paper, and Sampson began looking
through them. All at once he got up, made some odd sort of noise in his
throat, and rushed out by a door that was just by his desk. We sat there for
a minute or two, and then - I suppose it was incorrect - but we went up, I
and one or two others, to look at the papers on his desk. Of course I
thought someone must have put down some nonsense or other, and Sampson had
gone off to report him. All the same, I noticed that he hadn't taken any of
the papers with him when he ran out. Well, the top paper on the desk was
written in red ink - which no one used - and it wasn't in anyone's hand who
was in the class. They all looked at it - McLeod and all - and took their
dying oaths that it wasn't theirs. Then I thought of counting the bits of
paper. And of this I made quite certain: that there were seventeen bits of
paper on the desk, and sixteen boys in the form. Well, I bagged the extra
paper, and kept it, and I believe I have it now. And now you will want to
know what was written on it. It was simple enough, and harmless enough, I
should have said.

  "Could you show me the paper" interrupted the listener.

  "Yes, I could: but there's another odd thing about it. That same
afternoon I took it out of my locker - I know for certain it was the same
bit, for I made a finger-mark on it and no single trace of writing of any
kind was there on it. I kept it, as I said, and since that time I have tried
various experiments to see whether sympathetic ink had been used, but
absolutely without result.

  "So much for that. After about half an hour Sampson looked in again: said
he had felt very unwell, and told us we might go. He came rather gingerly to
his desk, and gave just one look at the uppermost paper: and I suppose he
thought he must have been dreaming: anyhow, he asked no questions.

  "That day was a half-holiday, and next day Sampson was in school again,
much as usual. That night the third and last incident in my story happened.

  "We - McLeod and I - slept in a dormitory at right angles to the main
building. Sampson slept in the main building on the first floor. There was a
very bright full moon. At an hour which I can't tell exactly, but some time
between one and two, I was woken up by somebody shaking me. It was McLeod,
and a nice state of mind he seemed to be in. 'Come' he said, - 'come
there's a burglar getting in through Sampson's window' As soon as I could
speak, I said, 'Well, why not call out and wake everybody up? 'No, no' he
said, 'I'm not sure who it is: don't make a row: come and look' Naturally I
came and looked, and naturally there was no one there. I was cross enough,
and should have called McLeod plenty of names: only - I couldn't tell why -
it seemed to me that there was something wrong - something that made me very
glad I wasn't alone to face it. We were still at the window looking out, and
as soon as I could, I asked him what he had heard or seen. 'I didn't hear
anything at all' he said, 'but about five minutes before I woke you, I
found myself looking out of this window here, and there was a man sitting or
kneeling on Sampson's window-sill, and looking in, and I thought he was
beckoning' 'What sort of man' McLeod wriggled. 'I don't know' he said,
'but I can tell you one thing - he was beastly thin: and he looked as if he
was wet all over: and' he said, looking round and whispering as if he
hardly liked to hear himself, 'I'm not at all sure that he was alive'

  "We went on talking in whispers some time longer, and eventually crept
back to bed. No one else in the room woke or stirred the whole time. I
believe we did sleep a bit afterwards, but we were very cheap next day.

  "And next day Mr. Sampson was gone: not to be found: and I believe no
trace of him has ever come to light since. In thinking it over, one of the
oddest things about it all has seemed to me to be the fact that neither
McLeod nor I ever mentioned what we had seen to any third person whatever.
Of course no questions were asked on the subject, and if they had been, I am
inclined to believe that we could not have made any answer: we seemed unable
to speak about it.

  "That is my story" said the narrator. "The only approach to a ghost
story connected with a school that I know, but still, I think, an approach
to such a thing"

  The sequel to this may perhaps be reckoned highly conventional; but a
sequel there is, and so it must be produced. There had been more than one
listener to the story, and, in the latter part of that same year, or of the
next, one such listener was staying at a country house in Ireland.

  One evening his host was turning over a drawer full of odds and ends in
the smoking-room. Suddenly he put his hand upon a little box. "Now" he
said, "you know about old things; tell me what that is." My friend opened
the little box, and found in it a thin gold chain with an object attached to
it. He glanced at the object and then took off his spectacles to examine it
more narrowly. "What's the history of this" he asked. "Odd enough" was the
answer. "You know the yew thicket in the shrubbery: well, a year or two back
we were cleaning out the old well that used to be in the clearing here, and
what do you suppose we found"

  "Is it possible that you found a body? said the visitor, with an odd
feeling of nervousness.



Then the wolf was very angry indeed, and tried to get down the chimney in order to eat up the little pig. When the little pig saw what he was about, he put a pot full of water on the blazing fire, and, just as the wolf was coming down, he took off the cover, and in fell the wolf. Quickly the little pig clapped on the cover, and when the wolf was boiled ate him for supper.

said the wolf. As usual the little pig went off before the time, and got to the fair, and bought a butter-churn, which he was rolling home when he saw the wolf coming. So he got into the churn to hide, and in so doing turned it round, and it rolled down the hill with the pig in it, which frightened the wolf so much that he ran home without going to the fair. He went to the little pig's house, and told him how frightened he had been by a great round thing which came past him down the hill. Then the little pig said.
apples, hoping to get back before the wolf came; but it took long to climb the tree, and just as he was coming down from it, he saw the wolf coming. When the wolf came up he said
And he threw it so far that, while the wolf was gone to pick it up, the little pig jumped down and ran home. The next day the wolf came again, and said to the little pig
The little pig said: "Ready! I have been and come back again, and got a nice potful for dinner"
So he huffed, and he puffed, and he huffed, and he puffed, and he puffed and huffed; but he could NOT get the house down. Finding that he could not, with all his huffing and puffing, blow the house down, he said Once upon a time there were three little pigs, who went from home to seek their fortune. The first that went off met a man with a bundle of straw, and said to him The Story of the Three Little Pigs. 


Portrait Professional is the easiest and fastest way to re-touch portraits in just five easy steps, allowing you to achieve professional results in minutes.

Portrait Professional works in a completely different way to ordinary airbrushing and photo editing software normally used by the pros. Portrait Professional has been trained with hundreds of examples of human beauty, and as a result you can add as much or as little photo enhancement as required - by simply moving sliders. 

In fact due to the innate knowledge of human beauty built into Portrait Professional, the highest quality photo touch-up can be achieved by anyone in just a few minutes.

Portrait Professional is available in three editions, Standard, Studio and Studio64. All editions are covered by this manual.

Portrait Professional is available for Windows and Mac computers.  This manual is for the Windows version.
Click on the female or male button to let Portrait Professional know whether the face is a female or male face.

If the image is not the right way up, click on the orientation button that matches the orientation of your image to rotate your image. The orientation buttons are at the bottom of the controls panel.
Portrait Professional will guide you through each step but have a look at the quick start guide below to familiarize yourself with the stages.
The Adjust The Outline stage shouldn't take you very long.

You don't need to painstakingly position every point. In fact, you will get better results if you don't.

The only points that need to be accurately positioned are those around the eyes and mouth. For other points, if it is automatically placed in roughly the right place, resist the urge to make tiny changes to its position.
When adjusting the outline, move points as little as possible to get them to the right place.

For example, when moving the points around the mouth, or around the face, just move them in or out to get them on the perimeter. Try to avoid moving the points around the perimeter.

The exception is corner points. The points at the corners of the eyes, or the corners of the mouth must go in the right place.
Don't push the sliders up too far

Often, you can greatly improve a picture with fairly subtle changes.

Push the sliders up just far enough to get the results you want.

If you go too far, the result can look unnatural or faked.

Don't use the sliders to fix small blemishes
You can avoid the need to push the sliders up too far by using the Touch-Up tool to clean up spots and blemishes. This is better than pushing the sliders further up because that affects the whole face.

Make sure the skin area is right

Portrait Professional automatically works out which areas in your picture are skin. However, the automatic area selected can sometimes be adjusted to improve the results.

Use the skin Extend and Cut Back tools to paint over any skin areas that are wrong.
The Studio edition comes with a Photoshop plug-in component.  This allows you to open an image in Portrait Professional Studio directly from within Photoshop. When you have finished enhancing the image in Portrait Professional, the result is automatically loaded back into Photoshop.
Only the Studio edition can read RAW image files and Adobe DNG files. 
The Studio edition allows you to select multiple files using the file browser to set up a list of files to work through.  This speeds up your work-flow, since you can use a single command after enhancing each image to save the result and load the next one.
Enhancing skin only

If there is no face in the picture, press the Enhance Skin Only button.  When you press this button, you will then be asked to select the skin area by painting over it using brush tools.

This option is only intended to be used if you want to use the skin enhancing when there is no face in the picture.  If there is a face, you will get much better results if you select the gender and follow the usual steps to position the lines over the face.  This will also usually be quicker since the skin area will be automatically selected.

If the Enhance Skin Only button is not shown, you need to enable it using the Show "Enhance Skin Only" Button checkbox in the General Settings dialog.

Adjust the image orientation

If your image is not the right way up, click on one of the buttons at the bottom of the controls panel. This will rotate your image in the direction shown by the arrows.

Note that you need to change the orientation before selecting the gender, since Portrait Professional automatically advances to the next step when you select the gender.
Locating the feature points

In the controls panel you can see an example of which point you need to click on next, as an image and as a text description.

Click on the corresponding position in your image.

If you hold down the mouse button when clicking in your image, you can see a cross appear. You can then drag the mouse to reposition the cross.

The cross will have a small text label next to it to remind you which point you are locating. These labels can be turned off if you don't like them using the General Settings panel.

As soon as you release the mouse after clicking, Portrait Professional automatically asks you to select the next feature position.  However, if you want to adjust the positions of any of the points you have already located, you can click on them and drag them.

Profile views

If the face is viewed side on, press the Profile View button at the bottom of the control panel.

If you are not sure whether the face is being viewed in profile or not, the main test is whether you can see both eyes.  If you can't see one of the eyes due to the head being turned, press the Profile View button.

When you press the Profile View button, you will only need to locate one eye point, the nose tip, and one mouth point.
If you press the Skip button, you will go straight to the final stage where you can view the enhanced image.  However, some of the sliders (those that make changes that need the outline to be accurately placed) will not be available.

If you make any changes to the outline positions, the skip button will no longer be shown. You will then need to press the Next button instead, to go through the rest of the features as described below.

Note: if this button does not appear, make sure the option Show "Skip To Final Step" Button is checked on the General Settings dialog.  Also, once you start making any changes to the outline, the skip button becomes hidden.

Adjusting the outline
Adjusting the outline for each feature

Portrait Professional will take you to each of the features in turn so that you can check, and if necessary, adjust the positioning of the selected outline of each feature.

You should only need to spend a few seconds on this step as Portrait Professional does not need to have the positions marked completely accurately.  Generally the smaller the adjustments you make here, the better the results.
Once you have been through all the features, press the Next button one more time to start Portrait Professional processing your image. You will then be taken to the Enhance Image step, where the fun begins!

The features

The features are shown in the following order. 

Left eye and eyebrow

The left corner of the left eye is in the position you selected in the previous step, locating the main features.

You may want to adjust it now that the image is zoomed in more closely on the eye, along with the other points around the eye.

Two blue circles are shown inside the eye. The smaller circle should fit around the pupil (the black part in the middle of the eye). The larger circle should fit around the iris (the colored part of the eye). These circles are positioned automatically, so you will not usually need to adjust them. If they are in the wrong place, wait until the eye outline has been set before adjusting them since the circle positions may be fixed once the eye outline is correct.

If you do need to move the circles, click on the point in the center of the circles. This lets you reposition the circles.

If you click on the eye center point, two more points appear, one on each circle. These points let you adjust the sizes of the circles so that they fit around the pupil and iris respectively. The positions of these points around the circle don't matter, they are only used to set the sizes of the circles.

Depending on the shape of the eyebrow, it can be difficult to get the outline to fit around the eyebrow.  In these cases, it is best to not worry about it and just get the position roughly correct.  Even if you are able to get the outline to fit around the eyebrow reasonably well, if you had to move the points a lot to get it to fit, you may get a better result by moving the points less even if the eyebrow outline no longer goes around the eyebrow accurately.

Right eye and eyebrow

The same comments about the left eye and eyebrow apply to the right eye and eyebrow.

Nose and Mouth

When you get to this stage the Mouth Open Or Closed panel will appear, provided it has not been turned off in the General Settings. This panel has two buttons:
Press this button if the mouth of the face you are enhancing is open. You will then see four lines between the corners of the mouth. The top two should be positioned around the upper lip, and the bottom two around the lower lip. If the line along the bottom of the top lip is placed close to the line along the top of the bottom lip, you will see the line along the top of the bottom lip disappear leaving just the control point in the middle.  The mouth will then be treated as closed anyway.
you are used to pressing the spacebar to quickly move on to the next stage, note you can also use this to dismiss the dialog asking if the mouth is open or closed. If this happens, the mouth will be selected as being open. If the mouth is in fact shut, you can either press the Back button followed by the Next button, and the panel will appear again, or you can simply move the middle two lines together.
Face outline

The face outline does not need to be set accurately. The same rule applies here, that you will get the best results if you only move those points that need it, and move those as little as possible.

Try to avoid moving the face outline points around the face, just move them towards or away from the face.
After you have adjusted the outline around the face in your image, you are ready to start enhancing the image.

Viewing the result

You can choose whether you want to see the before and after image side by side, or whether you just want the enhanced image as large as possible. Use the tabs above the images to select which option you prefer.

Whichever option you use, you can always flip the enhanced after image back to the original to see the changes by pressing and holding the Enter key.

Changing the result

Portrait Professional will automatically enhance your image when you reach this stage. See Saved Sliders for how to configure this default enhancement.

You can change how the image is enhanced by moving the sliders in the Controls panel.

The sliders are grouped into sections that control various aspects of the face. When you first enter this stage, the Face Sculpt Controls and Skin Controls sections are open, and the others are closed. Sections can be opened or closed by clicking on their title button. This has a small triangle pointing down if the section is open, or right if the section is closed.

Try moving the Master Fade slider in each section to get an idea of the overall effect controlled by that section.

The lower sliders in each section give you finer control over the effect.

Portrait Professional also comes with a set of Saved Sliders settings, which set some or all of the sliders to pre-defined values to get a particular effect. You can go through these to see some of the types of enhancement possible for your photo.

Fixing problems

Most problems with the enhanced images are caused either by one or more sliders being pushed up too far, or by the skin or hair areas being wrong.

Use the Brush tools to fix the skin and hair areas.
When you select this command, the original image stored in the software is effectively replaced with the enhanced image you have just created. You are then taken back to the Select Gender stage so that you can go through the process again for another face in your image.

You can repeat this process as many times as you need until every face in the image has been enhanced.

IMPORTANT: Please note that when you select this command, the changes to enhance the current face are fixed. You will no longer be able to make changes to the way the current face is enhanced.

You therefore need to make sure you are completely finished with each face before moving on to the next one.
Portrait Professional is designed to enhance portrait photos.

However, if your photo includes other parts of the body, then you can use the skin enhancement tools on other parts of the skin that can be seen.

To do this, all you need to do is make sure that the Portrait Professional knows which parts of the photo are skin. This is done using the skin area tools, as described in Skin Area.

 
Examples of applications that can call Portrait Professional as a plug-in in this way are Adobe Photoshop, when using the Portrait Professional Photoshop plug-in, and Adobe Lightroom, when Portrait Professional has been set as the optional external editor.

 Internal format of RAR and ZIP archives created by WinRAR allows to store practically any number of files of practically any size. Actual limits depend on the file system and available memory. Some older file systems do not support files larger than 4 GB.

WinRAR allocates memory to store name and attributes of every archiving file. If quick open information is added, twice more memory is required to store file name and attributes. While concrete amount depends on a file name length in UTF-8 encoding, typically we can just add several hundred bytes per file to memory required for compression dictionary to estimate memory use when archiving. Also please take into account that 32 bit WinRAR cannot use more than 2 GB of memory. If you need to process a lot of files or use large dictionaries, 64 bit WinRAR may be preferable.


First, you need to run WinRAR. Double-click or press Enter on the WinRAR icon. You can also start it from the Windows "Start menu": enter "Programs" then "WinRAR" and then run the "WinRAR" item.

When WinRAR is running, it displays a list of files and folders in the current folder. You need to go to the folder, which contains files to archive. You may use Ctrl+D, the disks list below the toolbar or click on the small disk icon in the bottom left corner, to change the current disk. Press BS, Ctrl+PgUp, small "Up" button below the toolbar or double-click on the folder named  to go to the parent folder. Press Enter, Ctrl+PgDn or double-click on any other folder to enter that folder. Ctrl+\ will set the root disk or archive folder as the current folder.

When you have entered the folder with the desired files, select the files and folders, which you are going to archive. This may be achieved by using Shift + arrow keys or the mouse as in Windows Explorer and other Windows programs. It is also possible, in WinRAR, to select files using Space or Ins keys. keys on the numeric keypad allow the selection of groups of files using file masks.

Having selected one or more files, click on the Add button at the top of the WinRAR window, press Alt+A or select the "Add files to archive" command in the Commands menu. Enter the destination archive name in the dialog box which appears or simply accept the default name. You may select, in this dialog, the format of the new archive ( RAR or ZIP) compression level, volume size and other archiving parameters. This dialog described in details in Archive name and parameters dialog topic. Click on the OK button when you are ready to create the archive.

During the archiving process, a window will be displayed showing operation statistics. If you wish to break the archiving process, click on the Cancel button in the command window. You may press the "Background" button in this window to minimize WinRAR to the tray. When archiving is completed, the command window disappears and the newly created archive becomes the currently selected file.

It is also possible to add files, to an existing RAR archive, using drag-and-drop. Select the desired archive in the WinRAR window and press Enter (or double click) on its name. RAR will read the archive and display its contents. You may now add files to the archive by simply dragging them from another program and dropping to WinRAR.

Chermak emphasized the importance of formally establishing a partnership structure so that when local union and contractor officials change, the partnership program remains.


Two men in a smoking-room were talking of their private-school days. "At our
school" said  "we had a ghost's footmark on the staircase. "

  " What was it like"

  "Oh, very unconvincing. Just the shape of a shoe, with a square toe, if I
remember right. The staircase was a stone one. I never heard any story about
the thing. That seems odd, when you come to think of it. Why didn't somebody
invent one, I wonder"

  "You never can tell with little boys. They have a mythology of their own.
There's a subject for you, by the way - "The Folklore of Private Schools"

  "Yes; the crop is rather scanty, though. I imagine, if you were to
investigate the cycle of ghost stories, for instance, which the boys at
private schools tell each other, they would all turn out to be
highly-compressed versions of stories out of books"

  "Nowadays the Strand and Pearson's, and so on, would be extensively drawn
upon"

  "No doubt: they weren't born or thought of in my time. Let's see. I
wonder if I can remember the staple ones that I was told. First, there was
the house with a room in which a series of people insisted on passing a
night; and each of them in the morning was found kneeling in a corner, and
had just time to say, 'I seen it' and died"

  "Wasn't that the house in Berkeley Square"

  "I dare say it was. Then there was the man who heard a noise in the
passage at night, opened his door, and saw someone crawling towards him on
all fours with his eye hanging out on his cheek. There was besides, let me
think - Yes! the room where a man was found dead in bed with a horseshoe
mark on his forehead, and the floor under the bed was covered with marks of
horseshoes also; I don't know why. Also there was the lady who, on locking
her bedroom door in a strange house, heard a thin voice among the
bed-curtains say, 'Now we're shut in for the night' None of those had any
explanation or sequel. I wonder if they go on still, those stories"

  "Oh, likely enough - with additions from the magazines, as I said. You
never heard, did you, of a real ghost at a private school? I thought not,
nobody has that ever I came across"

  "From the way in which you said that, I gather that you have"

  "I really don't know, but this is what was in my mind. It happened at my
private school thirty odd years ago, and I haven't any explanation of it.

  "The school I mean was near London. It was established in a large and
fairly old house - a great white building with very fine grounds about it;
there were large cedars in the garden, as there are in so many of the older
gardens in the Thames valley, and ancient elms in the three or four fields
which we used for our games. I think probably it was quite an attractive
place, but boys seldom allow that their schools possess any tolerable
features.

  "I came to the school in a September, soon after the year  and among
the boys who arrived on the same day was one whom I took to: a Highland boy,
whom I will call McLeod. I needn't spend time in describing him: the main
thing is that I got to know him very well. He was not an exceptional boy in
any way - not particularly good at books or games - but he suited me.

  "The school was a large one: there must have been from  boys
there as a rule, and so a considerable staff of masters was required, and
there were rather frequent changes among them.

  "One term - perhaps it was my third or fourth - a new master made his
appearance. His name was Sampson. He was a tallish, stoutish, pale,
black-bearded man. I think we liked him: he had travelled a good deal, and
had stories which amused us on our school walks, so that there was some
competition among us to get within earshot of him. I remember too - dear me,
I have hardly thought of it since then - that he had a charm on his
watch-chain that attracted my attention one day, and he let me examine it.
It was, I now suppose, a gold Byzantine coin; there was an effigy of some
absurd emperor on one side; the other side had been worn practically smooth,
and he had had cut on it - rather barbarously - his own initials,	
and a date, 24 July,  Yes, I can see it now: he told me he had picked
it up in Constantinople: it was about the size of a florin, perhaps rather
smaller.

  "Well, the first odd thing that happened was this. Sampson was doing
Latin grammar with us. One of his favourite methods - perhaps it is rather a
good one - was to make us construct sentences out of our own heads to
illustrate the rules he was trying to make us learn. Of course that is a
thing which gives a silly boy a chance of being impertinent: there are lots
of school stories in which that happens - or any-how there might be. But
Sampson was too good a disciplinarian for us to think of trying that on with
him. Now, on this occasion he was telling us how to express remembering in
Latin: and he ordered us each to make a sentence bringing in the verb
memini, 'I remember' Well, most of us made up some ordinary sentence such
as 'I remember my father, or 'He remembers his book' or something equally
uninteresting: and I dare say a good many put down memino librum meum, and
so forth: but the boy I mentioned - McLeod - was evidently thinking of
something more elaborate than that. The rest of us wanted to have our
sentences passed, and get on to something else, so some kicked him under the
desk, and I, who was next to him, poked him and whispered to him to look
sharp. But he didn't seem to attend. I looked at his paper and saw he had
put down nothing at all. So I jogged him again harder than before and
upbraided him sharply for keeping us all waiting. That did have some effect.
He started and seemed to wake up, and then very quickly he scribbled about a
couple of lines on his paper, and showed it up with the rest. As it was the
last, or nearly the last, to come in, and as Sampson had a good deal to say
to the boys who had written meminiscimus patri meo and the rest of it, it
turned out that the clock struck twelve before he had got to McLeod, and
McLeod had to wait afterwards to have his sentence corrected. There was
nothing much going on outside when I got out, so I waited for him to come.
He came very slowly when he did arrive, and I guessed there had been some
sort of trouble. 'Well,' I said, 'what did you get' 'Oh, I don't know'
said McLeod, 'nothing much: but I think Sampson's rather sick with me'
'Why, did you show him up some rot' 'No fear' he said. 'It was all right
as far as I could see: it was like this: Memento - that's right enough for
remember, and it takes a genitive, - memento putei inter quatuor taxos.'
'What silly rot' I said. 'What made you shove that down? What does it
mean' 'That's the funny part' said McLeod. not quite sure what it
does mean. All I know is, it just came into my head and I corked it down. I
know what I think it means, because just before I wrote it down I had a sort
of picture of it in my head: I believe it means "Remember the well among the
four" - what are those dark sort of trees that have red berries on them'
'Mountain ashes, I pose you mean' 'I never heard of them' said McLeod;
'no, I'll tell you - yews' 'Well, and what did Sampson say? 'Why, he was
jolly odd about it. When he read it he got up and went to the mantel-piece
and stopped quite a long time without saying anything, with his back to me.
And then he said, without turning round, and rather quiet, "What do you
suppose that means? I told him what I thought; only I couldn't remember the
name of the silly tree: and then he wanted to know why I put it down, and I
had to say something or other. And after that he left off talking about it,
and asked me how long I'd been here, and where my people lived, and things
like that: and then I came away: but he wasn't looking a bit well'

  "I don't remember any more that was said by either of us about this. Next
day McLeod took to his bed with a chill or something of the kind, and it was
a week or more before he was in school again. And as much as a month went by
without anything happening that was noticeable. Whether or not Mr. Sampson
was really startled, as McLeod had thought, he didn't show it. I am pretty
sure, of course, now, that there was something very curious in his past
history, but I'm not going to pretend that we boys were sharp enough to
guess any such thing.

  "There was one other incident of the same kind as the last which I told
you. Several times since that day we had had to make up examples in school
to illustrate different rules, but there had never been any row except when
we did them wrong. At last there came a day when we were going through those
dismal things which people call Conditional Sentences, and we were told to
make a conditional sentence, expressing a future consequence. We did it,
right or wrong, and showed up our bits of paper, and Sampson began looking
through them. All at once he got up, made some odd sort of noise in his
throat, and rushed out by a door that was just by his desk. We sat there for
a minute or two, and then - I suppose it was incorrect - but we went up, I
and one or two others, to look at the papers on his desk. Of course I
thought someone must have put down some nonsense or other, and Sampson had
gone off to report him. All the same, I noticed that he hadn't taken any of
the papers with him when he ran out. Well, the top paper on the desk was
written in red ink - which no one used - and it wasn't in anyone's hand who
was in the class. They all looked at it - McLeod and all - and took their
dying oaths that it wasn't theirs. Then I thought of counting the bits of
paper. And of this I made quite certain: that there were seventeen bits of
paper on the desk, and sixteen boys in the form. Well, I bagged the extra
paper, and kept it, and I believe I have it now. And now you will want to
know what was written on it. It was simple enough, and harmless enough, I
should have said.

  "Could you show me the paper" interrupted the listener.

  "Yes, I could: but there's another odd thing about it. That same
afternoon I took it out of my locker - I know for certain it was the same
bit, for I made a finger-mark on it and no single trace of writing of any
kind was there on it. I kept it, as I said, and since that time I have tried
various experiments to see whether sympathetic ink had been used, but
absolutely without result.

  "So much for that. After about half an hour Sampson looked in again: said
he had felt very unwell, and told us we might go. He came rather gingerly to
his desk, and gave just one look at the uppermost paper: and I suppose he
thought he must have been dreaming: anyhow, he asked no questions.

  "That day was a half-holiday, and next day Sampson was in school again,
much as usual. That night the third and last incident in my story happened.

  "We - McLeod and I - slept in a dormitory at right angles to the main
building. Sampson slept in the main building on the first floor. There was a
very bright full moon. At an hour which I can't tell exactly, but some time
between one and two, I was woken up by somebody shaking me. It was McLeod,
and a nice state of mind he seemed to be in. 'Come' he said, - 'come
there's a burglar getting in through Sampson's window' As soon as I could
speak, I said, 'Well, why not call out and wake everybody up? 'No, no' he
said, 'I'm not sure who it is: don't make a row: come and look' Naturally I
came and looked, and naturally there was no one there. I was cross enough,
and should have called McLeod plenty of names: only - I couldn't tell why -
it seemed to me that there was something wrong - something that made me very
glad I wasn't alone to face it. We were still at the window looking out, and
as soon as I could, I asked him what he had heard or seen. 'I didn't hear
anything at all' he said, 'but about five minutes before I woke you, I
found myself looking out of this window here, and there was a man sitting or
kneeling on Sampson's window-sill, and looking in, and I thought he was
beckoning' 'What sort of man' McLeod wriggled. 'I don't know' he said,
'but I can tell you one thing - he was beastly thin: and he looked as if he
was wet all over: and' he said, looking round and whispering as if he
hardly liked to hear himself, 'I'm not at all sure that he was alive'

  "We went on talking in whispers some time longer, and eventually crept
back to bed. No one else in the room woke or stirred the whole time. I
believe we did sleep a bit afterwards, but we were very cheap next day.

  "And next day Mr. Sampson was gone: not to be found: and I believe no
trace of him has ever come to light since. In thinking it over, one of the
oddest things about it all has seemed to me to be the fact that neither
McLeod nor I ever mentioned what we had seen to any third person whatever.
Of course no questions were asked on the subject, and if they had been, I am
inclined to believe that we could not have made any answer: we seemed unable
to speak about it.

  "That is my story" said the narrator. "The only approach to a ghost
story connected with a school that I know, but still, I think, an approach
to such a thing"

  The sequel to this may perhaps be reckoned highly conventional; but a
sequel there is, and so it must be produced. There had been more than one
listener to the story, and, in the latter part of that same year, or of the
next, one such listener was staying at a country house in Ireland.

  One evening his host was turning over a drawer full of odds and ends in
the smoking-room. Suddenly he put his hand upon a little box. "Now" he
said, "you know about old things; tell me what that is." My friend opened
the little box, and found in it a thin gold chain with an object attached to
it. He glanced at the object and then took off his spectacles to examine it
more narrowly. "What's the history of this" he asked. "Odd enough" was the
answer. "You know the yew thicket in the shrubbery: well, a year or two back
we were cleaning out the old well that used to be in the clearing here, and
what do you suppose we found"

  "Is it possible that you found a body? said the visitor, with an odd
feeling of nervousness.



Then the wolf was very angry indeed, and tried to get down the chimney in order to eat up the little pig. When the little pig saw what he was about, he put a pot full of water on the blazing fire, and, just as the wolf was coming down, he took off the cover, and in fell the wolf. Quickly the little pig clapped on the cover, and when the wolf was boiled ate him for supper.

said the wolf. As usual the little pig went off before the time, and got to the fair, and bought a butter-churn, which he was rolling home when he saw the wolf coming. So he got into the churn to hide, and in so doing turned it round, and it rolled down the hill with the pig in it, which frightened the wolf so much that he ran home without going to the fair. He went to the little pig's house, and told him how frightened he had been by a great round thing which came past him down the hill. Then the little pig said.
apples, hoping to get back before the wolf came; but it took long to climb the tree, and just as he was coming down from it, he saw the wolf coming. When the wolf came up he said
And he threw it so far that, while the wolf was gone to pick it up, the little pig jumped down and ran home. The next day the wolf came again, and said to the little pig
The little pig said: "Ready! I have been and come back again, and got a nice potful for dinner"
So he huffed, and he puffed, and he huffed, and he puffed, and he puffed and huffed; but he could NOT get the house down. Finding that he could not, with all his huffing and puffing, blow the house down, he said Once upon a time there were three little pigs, who went from home to seek their fortune. The first that went off met a man with a bundle of straw, and said to him The Story of the Three Little Pigs. 


Portrait Professional is the easiest and fastest way to re-touch portraits in just five easy steps, allowing you to achieve professional results in minutes.

Portrait Professional works in a completely different way to ordinary airbrushing and photo editing software normally used by the pros. Portrait Professional has been trained with hundreds of examples of human beauty, and as a result you can add as much or as little photo enhancement as required - by simply moving sliders. 

In fact due to the innate knowledge of human beauty built into Portrait Professional, the highest quality photo touch-up can be achieved by anyone in just a few minutes.

Portrait Professional is available in three editions, Standard, Studio and Studio64. All editions are covered by this manual.

Portrait Professional is available for Windows and Mac computers.  This manual is for the Windows version.
Click on the female or male button to let Portrait Professional know whether the face is a female or male face.

If the image is not the right way up, click on the orientation button that matches the orientation of your image to rotate your image. The orientation buttons are at the bottom of the controls panel.
Portrait Professional will guide you through each step but have a look at the quick start guide below to familiarize yourself with the stages.
The Adjust The Outline stage shouldn't take you very long.

You don't need to painstakingly position every point. In fact, you will get better results if you don't.

The only points that need to be accurately positioned are those around the eyes and mouth. For other points, if it is automatically placed in roughly the right place, resist the urge to make tiny changes to its position.
When adjusting the outline, move points as little as possible to get them to the right place.

For example, when moving the points around the mouth, or around the face, just move them in or out to get them on the perimeter. Try to avoid moving the points around the perimeter.

The exception is corner points. The points at the corners of the eyes, or the corners of the mouth must go in the right place.
Don't push the sliders up too far

Often, you can greatly improve a picture with fairly subtle changes.

Push the sliders up just far enough to get the results you want.

If you go too far, the result can look unnatural or faked.

Don't use the sliders to fix small blemishes
You can avoid the need to push the sliders up too far by using the Touch-Up tool to clean up spots and blemishes. This is better than pushing the sliders further up because that affects the whole face.

Make sure the skin area is right

Portrait Professional automatically works out which areas in your picture are skin. However, the automatic area selected can sometimes be adjusted to improve the results.

Use the skin Extend and Cut Back tools to paint over any skin areas that are wrong.
The Studio edition comes with a Photoshop plug-in component.  This allows you to open an image in Portrait Professional Studio directly from within Photoshop. When you have finished enhancing the image in Portrait Professional, the result is automatically loaded back into Photoshop.
Only the Studio edition can read RAW image files and Adobe DNG files. 
The Studio edition allows you to select multiple files using the file browser to set up a list of files to work through.  This speeds up your work-flow, since you can use a single command after enhancing each image to save the result and load the next one.
Enhancing skin only

If there is no face in the picture, press the Enhance Skin Only button.  When you press this button, you will then be asked to select the skin area by painting over it using brush tools.

This option is only intended to be used if you want to use the skin enhancing when there is no face in the picture.  If there is a face, you will get much better results if you select the gender and follow the usual steps to position the lines over the face.  This will also usually be quicker since the skin area will be automatically selected.

If the Enhance Skin Only button is not shown, you need to enable it using the Show "Enhance Skin Only" Button checkbox in the General Settings dialog.

Adjust the image orientation

If your image is not the right way up, click on one of the buttons at the bottom of the controls panel. This will rotate your image in the direction shown by the arrows.

Note that you need to change the orientation before selecting the gender, since Portrait Professional automatically advances to the next step when you select the gender.
Locating the feature points

In the controls panel you can see an example of which point you need to click on next, as an image and as a text description.

Click on the corresponding position in your image.

If you hold down the mouse button when clicking in your image, you can see a cross appear. You can then drag the mouse to reposition the cross.

The cross will have a small text label next to it to remind you which point you are locating. These labels can be turned off if you don't like them using the General Settings panel.

As soon as you release the mouse after clicking, Portrait Professional automatically asks you to select the next feature position.  However, if you want to adjust the positions of any of the points you have already located, you can click on them and drag them.

Profile views

If the face is viewed side on, press the Profile View button at the bottom of the control panel.

If you are not sure whether the face is being viewed in profile or not, the main test is whether you can see both eyes.  If you can't see one of the eyes due to the head being turned, press the Profile View button.

When you press the Profile View button, you will only need to locate one eye point, the nose tip, and one mouth point.
If you press the Skip button, you will go straight to the final stage where you can view the enhanced image.  However, some of the sliders (those that make changes that need the outline to be accurately placed) will not be available.

If you make any changes to the outline positions, the skip button will no longer be shown. You will then need to press the Next button instead, to go through the rest of the features as described below.

Note: if this button does not appear, make sure the option Show "Skip To Final Step" Button is checked on the General Settings dialog.  Also, once you start making any changes to the outline, the skip button becomes hidden.

Adjusting the outline
Adjusting the outline for each feature

Portrait Professional will take you to each of the features in turn so that you can check, and if necessary, adjust the positioning of the selected outline of each feature.

You should only need to spend a few seconds on this step as Portrait Professional does not need to have the positions marked completely accurately.  Generally the smaller the adjustments you make here, the better the results.
Once you have been through all the features, press the Next button one more time to start Portrait Professional processing your image. You will then be taken to the Enhance Image step, where the fun begins!

The features

The features are shown in the following order. 

Left eye and eyebrow

The left corner of the left eye is in the position you selected in the previous step, locating the main features.

You may want to adjust it now that the image is zoomed in more closely on the eye, along with the other points around the eye.

Two blue circles are shown inside the eye. The smaller circle should fit around the pupil (the black part in the middle of the eye). The larger circle should fit around the iris (the colored part of the eye). These circles are positioned automatically, so you will not usually need to adjust them. If they are in the wrong place, wait until the eye outline has been set before adjusting them since the circle positions may be fixed once the eye outline is correct.

If you do need to move the circles, click on the point in the center of the circles. This lets you reposition the circles.

If you click on the eye center point, two more points appear, one on each circle. These points let you adjust the sizes of the circles so that they fit around the pupil and iris respectively. The positions of these points around the circle don't matter, they are only used to set the sizes of the circles.

Depending on the shape of the eyebrow, it can be difficult to get the outline to fit around the eyebrow.  In these cases, it is best to not worry about it and just get the position roughly correct.  Even if you are able to get the outline to fit around the eyebrow reasonably well, if you had to move the points a lot to get it to fit, you may get a better result by moving the points less even if the eyebrow outline no longer goes around the eyebrow accurately.

Right eye and eyebrow

The same comments about the left eye and eyebrow apply to the right eye and eyebrow.

Nose and Mouth

When you get to this stage the Mouth Open Or Closed panel will appear, provided it has not been turned off in the General Settings. This panel has two buttons:
Press this button if the mouth of the face you are enhancing is open. You will then see four lines between the corners of the mouth. The top two should be positioned around the upper lip, and the bottom two around the lower lip. If the line along the bottom of the top lip is placed close to the line along the top of the bottom lip, you will see the line along the top of the bottom lip disappear leaving just the control point in the middle.  The mouth will then be treated as closed anyway.
you are used to pressing the spacebar to quickly move on to the next stage, note you can also use this to dismiss the dialog asking if the mouth is open or closed. If this happens, the mouth will be selected as being open. If the mouth is in fact shut, you can either press the Back button followed by the Next button, and the panel will appear again, or you can simply move the middle two lines together.
Face outline

The face outline does not need to be set accurately. The same rule applies here, that you will get the best results if you only move those points that need it, and move those as little as possible.

Try to avoid moving the face outline points around the face, just move them towards or away from the face.
After you have adjusted the outline around the face in your image, you are ready to start enhancing the image.

Viewing the result

You can choose whether you want to see the before and after image side by side, or whether you just want the enhanced image as large as possible. Use the tabs above the images to select which option you prefer.

Whichever option you use, you can always flip the enhanced after image back to the original to see the changes by pressing and holding the Enter key.

Changing the result

Portrait Professional will automatically enhance your image when you reach this stage. See Saved Sliders for how to configure this default enhancement.

You can change how the image is enhanced by moving the sliders in the Controls panel.

The sliders are grouped into sections that control various aspects of the face. When you first enter this stage, the Face Sculpt Controls and Skin Controls sections are open, and the others are closed. Sections can be opened or closed by clicking on their title button. This has a small triangle pointing down if the section is open, or right if the section is closed.

Try moving the Master Fade slider in each section to get an idea of the overall effect controlled by that section.

The lower sliders in each section give you finer control over the effect.

Portrait Professional also comes with a set of Saved Sliders settings, which set some or all of the sliders to pre-defined values to get a particular effect. You can go through these to see some of the types of enhancement possible for your photo.

Fixing problems

Most problems with the enhanced images are caused either by one or more sliders being pushed up too far, or by the skin or hair areas being wrong.

Use the Brush tools to fix the skin and hair areas.
When you select this command, the original image stored in the software is effectively replaced with the enhanced image you have just created. You are then taken back to the Select Gender stage so that you can go through the process again for another face in your image.

You can repeat this process as many times as you need until every face in the image has been enhanced.

IMPORTANT: Please note that when you select this command, the changes to enhance the current face are fixed. You will no longer be able to make changes to the way the current face is enhanced.

You therefore need to make sure you are completely finished with each face before moving on to the next one.
Portrait Professional is designed to enhance portrait photos.

However, if your photo includes other parts of the body, then you can use the skin enhancement tools on other parts of the skin that can be seen.

To do this, all you need to do is make sure that the Portrait Professional knows which parts of the photo are skin. This is done using the skin area tools, as described in Skin Area.

 
Examples of applications that can call Portrait Professional as a plug-in in this way are Adobe Photoshop, when using the Portrait Professional Photoshop plug-in, and Adobe Lightroom, when Portrait Professional has been set as the optional external editor.

 Internal format of RAR and ZIP archives created by WinRAR allows to store practically any number of files of practically any size. Actual limits depend on the file system and available memory. Some older file systems do not support files larger than 4 GB.

WinRAR allocates memory to store name and attributes of every archiving file. If quick open information is added, twice more memory is required to store file name and attributes. While concrete amount depends on a file name length in UTF-8 encoding, typically we can just add several hundred bytes per file to memory required for compression dictionary to estimate memory use when archiving. Also please take into account that 32 bit WinRAR cannot use more than 2 GB of memory. If you need to process a lot of files or use large dictionaries, 64 bit WinRAR may be preferable.


First, you need to run WinRAR. Double-click or press Enter on the WinRAR icon. You can also start it from the Windows "Start menu": enter "Programs" then "WinRAR" and then run the "WinRAR" item.

When WinRAR is running, it displays a list of files and folders in the current folder. You need to go to the folder, which contains files to archive. You may use Ctrl+D, the disks list below the toolbar or click on the small disk icon in the bottom left corner, to change the current disk. Press BS, Ctrl+PgUp, small "Up" button below the toolbar or double-click on the folder named  to go to the parent folder. Press Enter, Ctrl+PgDn or double-click on any other folder to enter that folder. Ctrl+\ will set the root disk or archive folder as the current folder.

When you have entered the folder with the desired files, select the files and folders, which you are going to archive. This may be achieved by using Shift + arrow keys or the mouse as in Windows Explorer and other Windows programs. It is also possible, in WinRAR, to select files using Space or Ins keys. keys on the numeric keypad allow the selection of groups of files using file masks.

Having selected one or more files, click on the Add button at the top of the WinRAR window, press Alt+A or select the "Add files to archive" command in the Commands menu. Enter the destination archive name in the dialog box which appears or simply accept the default name. You may select, in this dialog, the format of the new archive ( RAR or ZIP) compression level, volume size and other archiving parameters. This dialog described in details in Archive name and parameters dialog topic. Click on the OK button when you are ready to create the archive.

During the archiving process, a window will be displayed showing operation statistics. If you wish to break the archiving process, click on the Cancel button in the command window. You may press the "Background" button in this window to minimize WinRAR to the tray. When archiving is completed, the command window disappears and the newly created archive becomes the currently selected file.

It is also possible to add files, to an existing RAR archive, using drag-and-drop. Select the desired archive in the WinRAR window and press Enter (or double click) on its name. RAR will read the archive and display its contents. You may now add files to the archive by simply dragging them from another program and dropping to WinRAR.

Chermak emphasized the importance of formally establishing a partnership structure so that when local union and contractor officials change, the partnership program remains.


Two men in a smoking-room were talking of their private-school days. "At our
school" said  "we had a ghost's footmark on the staircase. "

  " What was it like"

  "Oh, very unconvincing. Just the shape of a shoe, with a square toe, if I
remember right. The staircase was a stone one. I never heard any story about
the thing. That seems odd, when you come to think of it. Why didn't somebody
invent one, I wonder"

  "You never can tell with little boys. They have a mythology of their own.
There's a subject for you, by the way - "The Folklore of Private Schools"

  "Yes; the crop is rather scanty, though. I imagine, if you were to
investigate the cycle of ghost stories, for instance, which the boys at
private schools tell each other, they would all turn out to be
highly-compressed versions of stories out of books"

  "Nowadays the Strand and Pearson's, and so on, would be extensively drawn
upon"

  "No doubt: they weren't born or thought of in my time. Let's see. I
wonder if I can remember the staple ones that I was told. First, there was
the house with a room in which a series of people insisted on passing a
night; and each of them in the morning was found kneeling in a corner, and
had just time to say, 'I seen it' and died"

  "Wasn't that the house in Berkeley Square"

  "I dare say it was. Then there was the man who heard a noise in the
passage at night, opened his door, and saw someone crawling towards him on
all fours with his eye hanging out on his cheek. There was besides, let me
think - Yes! the room where a man was found dead in bed with a horseshoe
mark on his forehead, and the floor under the bed was covered with marks of
horseshoes also; I don't know why. Also there was the lady who, on locking
her bedroom door in a strange house, heard a thin voice among the
bed-curtains say, 'Now we're shut in for the night' None of those had any
explanation or sequel. I wonder if they go on still, those stories"

  "Oh, likely enough - with additions from the magazines, as I said. You
never heard, did you, of a real ghost at a private school? I thought not,
nobody has that ever I came across"

  "From the way in which you said that, I gather that you have"

  "I really don't know, but this is what was in my mind. It happened at my
private school thirty odd years ago, and I haven't any explanation of it.

  "The school I mean was near London. It was established in a large and
fairly old house - a great white building with very fine grounds about it;
there were large cedars in the garden, as there are in so many of the older
gardens in the Thames valley, and ancient elms in the three or four fields
which we used for our games. I think probably it was quite an attractive
place, but boys seldom allow that their schools possess any tolerable
features.

  "I came to the school in a September, soon after the year  and among
the boys who arrived on the same day was one whom I took to: a Highland boy,
whom I will call McLeod. I needn't spend time in describing him: the main
thing is that I got to know him very well. He was not an exceptional boy in
any way - not particularly good at books or games - but he suited me.

  "The school was a large one: there must have been from  boys
there as a rule, and so a considerable staff of masters was required, and
there were rather frequent changes among them.

  "One term - perhaps it was my third or fourth - a new master made his
appearance. His name was Sampson. He was a tallish, stoutish, pale,
black-bearded man. I think we liked him: he had travelled a good deal, and
had stories which amused us on our school walks, so that there was some
competition among us to get within earshot of him. I remember too - dear me,
I have hardly thought of it since then - that he had a charm on his
watch-chain that attracted my attention one day, and he let me examine it.
It was, I now suppose, a gold Byzantine coin; there was an effigy of some
absurd emperor on one side; the other side had been worn practically smooth,
and he had had cut on it - rather barbarously - his own initials,	
and a date, 24 July,  Yes, I can see it now: he told me he had picked
it up in Constantinople: it was about the size of a florin, perhaps rather
smaller.

  "Well, the first odd thing that happened was this. Sampson was doing
Latin grammar with us. One of his favourite methods - perhaps it is rather a
good one - was to make us construct sentences out of our own heads to
illustrate the rules he was trying to make us learn. Of course that is a
thing which gives a silly boy a chance of being impertinent: there are lots
of school stories in which that happens - or any-how there might be. But
Sampson was too good a disciplinarian for us to think of trying that on with
him. Now, on this occasion he was telling us how to express remembering in
Latin: and he ordered us each to make a sentence bringing in the verb
memini, 'I remember' Well, most of us made up some ordinary sentence such
as 'I remember my father, or 'He remembers his book' or something equally
uninteresting: and I dare say a good many put down memino librum meum, and
so forth: but the boy I mentioned - McLeod - was evidently thinking of
something more elaborate than that. The rest of us wanted to have our
sentences passed, and get on to something else, so some kicked him under the
desk, and I, who was next to him, poked him and whispered to him to look
sharp. But he didn't seem to attend. I looked at his paper and saw he had
put down nothing at all. So I jogged him again harder than before and
upbraided him sharply for keeping us all waiting. That did have some effect.
He started and seemed to wake up, and then very quickly he scribbled about a
couple of lines on his paper, and showed it up with the rest. As it was the
last, or nearly the last, to come in, and as Sampson had a good deal to say
to the boys who had written meminiscimus patri meo and the rest of it, it
turned out that the clock struck twelve before he had got to McLeod, and
McLeod had to wait afterwards to have his sentence corrected. There was
nothing much going on outside when I got out, so I waited for him to come.
He came very slowly when he did arrive, and I guessed there had been some
sort of trouble. 'Well,' I said, 'what did you get' 'Oh, I don't know'
said McLeod, 'nothing much: but I think Sampson's rather sick with me'
'Why, did you show him up some rot' 'No fear' he said. 'It was all right
as far as I could see: it was like this: Memento - that's right enough for
remember, and it takes a genitive, - memento putei inter quatuor taxos.'
'What silly rot' I said. 'What made you shove that down? What does it
mean' 'That's the funny part' said McLeod. not quite sure what it
does mean. All I know is, it just came into my head and I corked it down. I
know what I think it means, because just before I wrote it down I had a sort
of picture of it in my head: I believe it means "Remember the well among the
four" - what are those dark sort of trees that have red berries on them'
'Mountain ashes, I pose you mean' 'I never heard of them' said McLeod;
'no, I'll tell you - yews' 'Well, and what did Sampson say? 'Why, he was
jolly odd about it. When he read it he got up and went to the mantel-piece
and stopped quite a long time without saying anything, with his back to me.
And then he said, without turning round, and rather quiet, "What do you
suppose that means? I told him what I thought; only I couldn't remember the
name of the silly tree: and then he wanted to know why I put it down, and I
had to say something or other. And after that he left off talking about it,
and asked me how long I'd been here, and where my people lived, and things
like that: and then I came away: but he wasn't looking a bit well'

  "I don't remember any more that was said by either of us about this. Next
day McLeod took to his bed with a chill or something of the kind, and it was
a week or more before he was in school again. And as much as a month went by
without anything happening that was noticeable. Whether or not Mr. Sampson
was really startled, as McLeod had thought, he didn't show it. I am pretty
sure, of course, now, that there was something very curious in his past
history, but I'm not going to pretend that we boys were sharp enough to
guess any such thing.

  "There was one other incident of the same kind as the last which I told
you. Several times since that day we had had to make up examples in school
to illustrate different rules, but there had never been any row except when
we did them wrong. At last there came a day when we were going through those
dismal things which people call Conditional Sentences, and we were told to
make a conditional sentence, expressing a future consequence. We did it,
right or wrong, and showed up our bits of paper, and Sampson began looking
through them. All at once he got up, made some odd sort of noise in his
throat, and rushed out by a door that was just by his desk. We sat there for
a minute or two, and then - I suppose it was incorrect - but we went up, I
and one or two others, to look at the papers on his desk. Of course I
thought someone must have put down some nonsense or other, and Sampson had
gone off to report him. All the same, I noticed that he hadn't taken any of
the papers with him when he ran out. Well, the top paper on the desk was
written in red ink - which no one used - and it wasn't in anyone's hand who
was in the class. They all looked at it - McLeod and all - and took their
dying oaths that it wasn't theirs. Then I thought of counting the bits of
paper. And of this I made quite certain: that there were seventeen bits of
paper on the desk, and sixteen boys in the form. Well, I bagged the extra
paper, and kept it, and I believe I have it now. And now you will want to
know what was written on it. It was simple enough, and harmless enough, I
should have said.

  "Could you show me the paper" interrupted the listener.

  "Yes, I could: but there's another odd thing about it. That same
afternoon I took it out of my locker - I know for certain it was the same
bit, for I made a finger-mark on it and no single trace of writing of any
kind was there on it. I kept it, as I said, and since that time I have tried
various experiments to see whether sympathetic ink had been used, but
absolutely without result.

  "So much for that. After about half an hour Sampson looked in again: said
he had felt very unwell, and told us we might go. He came rather gingerly to
his desk, and gave just one look at the uppermost paper: and I suppose he
thought he must have been dreaming: anyhow, he asked no questions.

  "That day was a half-holiday, and next day Sampson was in school again,
much as usual. That night the third and last incident in my story happened.

  "We - McLeod and I - slept in a dormitory at right angles to the main
building. Sampson slept in the main building on the first floor. There was a
very bright full moon. At an hour which I can't tell exactly, but some time
between one and two, I was woken up by somebody shaking me. It was McLeod,
and a nice state of mind he seemed to be in. 'Come' he said, - 'come
there's a burglar getting in through Sampson's window' As soon as I could
speak, I said, 'Well, why not call out and wake everybody up? 'No, no' he
said, 'I'm not sure who it is: don't make a row: come and look' Naturally I
came and looked, and naturally there was no one there. I was cross enough,
and should have called McLeod plenty of names: only - I couldn't tell why -
it seemed to me that there was something wrong - something that made me very
glad I wasn't alone to face it. We were still at the window looking out, and
as soon as I could, I asked him what he had heard or seen. 'I didn't hear
anything at all' he said, 'but about five minutes before I woke you, I
found myself looking out of this window here, and there was a man sitting or
kneeling on Sampson's window-sill, and looking in, and I thought he was
beckoning' 'What sort of man' McLeod wriggled. 'I don't know' he said,
'but I can tell you one thing - he was beastly thin: and he looked as if he
was wet all over: and' he said, looking round and whispering as if he
hardly liked to hear himself, 'I'm not at all sure that he was alive'

  "We went on talking in whispers some time longer, and eventually crept
back to bed. No one else in the room woke or stirred the whole time. I
believe we did sleep a bit afterwards, but we were very cheap next day.

  "And next day Mr. Sampson was gone: not to be found: and I believe no
trace of him has ever come to light since. In thinking it over, one of the
oddest things about it all has seemed to me to be the fact that neither
McLeod nor I ever mentioned what we had seen to any third person whatever.
Of course no questions were asked on the subject, and if they had been, I am
inclined to believe that we could not have made any answer: we seemed unable
to speak about it.

  "That is my story" said the narrator. "The only approach to a ghost
story connected with a school that I know, but still, I think, an approach
to such a thing"

  The sequel to this may perhaps be reckoned highly conventional; but a
sequel there is, and so it must be produced. There had been more than one
listener to the story, and, in the latter part of that same year, or of the
next, one such listener was staying at a country house in Ireland.

  One evening his host was turning over a drawer full of odds and ends in
the smoking-room. Suddenly he put his hand upon a little box. "Now" he
said, "you know about old things; tell me what that is." My friend opened
the little box, and found in it a thin gold chain with an object attached to
it. He glanced at the object and then took off his spectacles to examine it
more narrowly. "What's the history of this" he asked. "Odd enough" was the
answer. "You know the yew thicket in the shrubbery: well, a year or two back
we were cleaning out the old well that used to be in the clearing here, and
what do you suppose we found"

  "Is it possible that you found a body? said the visitor, with an odd
feeling of nervousness.



Then the wolf was very angry indeed, and tried to get down the chimney in order to eat up the little pig. When the little pig saw what he was about, he put a pot full of water on the blazing fire, and, just as the wolf was coming down, he took off the cover, and in fell the wolf. Quickly the little pig clapped on the cover, and when the wolf was boiled ate him for supper.

said the wolf. As usual the little pig went off before the time, and got to the fair, and bought a butter-churn, which he was rolling home when he saw the wolf coming. So he got into the churn to hide, and in so doing turned it round, and it rolled down the hill with the pig in it, which frightened the wolf so much that he ran home without going to the fair. He went to the little pig's house, and told him how frightened he had been by a great round thing which came past him down the hill. Then the little pig said.
apples, hoping to get back before the wolf came; but it took long to climb the tree, and just as he was coming down from it, he saw the wolf coming. When the wolf came up he said
And he threw it so far that, while the wolf was gone to pick it up, the little pig jumped down and ran home. The next day the wolf came again, and said to the little pig
The little pig said: "Ready! I have been and come back again, and got a nice potful for dinner"
So he huffed, and he puffed, and he huffed, and he puffed, and he puffed and huffed; but he could NOT get the house down. Finding that he could not, with all his huffing and puffing, blow the house down, he said Once upon a time there were three little pigs, who went from home to seek their fortune. The first that went off met a man with a bundle of straw, and said to him The Story of the Three Little Pigs. 


Portrait Professional is the easiest and fastest way to re-touch portraits in just five easy steps, allowing you to achieve professional results in minutes.

Portrait Professional works in a completely different way to ordinary airbrushing and photo editing software normally used by the pros. Portrait Professional has been trained with hundreds of examples of human beauty, and as a result you can add as much or as little photo enhancement as required - by simply moving sliders. 

In fact due to the innate knowledge of human beauty built into Portrait Professional, the highest quality photo touch-up can be achieved by anyone in just a few minutes.

Portrait Professional is available in three editions, Standard, Studio and Studio64. All editions are covered by this manual.

Portrait Professional is available for Windows and Mac computers.  This manual is for the Windows version.
Click on the female or male button to let Portrait Professional know whether the face is a female or male face.

If the image is not the right way up, click on the orientation button that matches the orientation of your image to rotate your image. The orientation buttons are at the bottom of the controls panel.
Portrait Professional will guide you through each step but have a look at the quick start guide below to familiarize yourself with the stages.
The Adjust The Outline stage shouldn't take you very long.

You don't need to painstakingly position every point. In fact, you will get better results if you don't.

The only points that need to be accurately positioned are those around the eyes and mouth. For other points, if it is automatically placed in roughly the right place, resist the urge to make tiny changes to its position.
When adjusting the outline, move points as little as possible to get them to the right place.

For example, when moving the points around the mouth, or around the face, just move them in or out to get them on the perimeter. Try to avoid moving the points around the perimeter.

The exception is corner points. The points at the corners of the eyes, or the corners of the mouth must go in the right place.
Don't push the sliders up too far

Often, you can greatly improve a picture with fairly subtle changes.

Push the sliders up just far enough to get the results you want.

If you go too far, the result can look unnatural or faked.

Don't use the sliders to fix small blemishes
You can avoid the need to push the sliders up too far by using the Touch-Up tool to clean up spots and blemishes. This is better than pushing the sliders further up because that affects the whole face.

Make sure the skin area is right

Portrait Professional automatically works out which areas in your picture are skin. However, the automatic area selected can sometimes be adjusted to improve the results.

Use the skin Extend and Cut Back tools to paint over any skin areas that are wrong.
The Studio edition comes with a Photoshop plug-in component.  This allows you to open an image in Portrait Professional Studio directly from within Photoshop. When you have finished enhancing the image in Portrait Professional, the result is automatically loaded back into Photoshop.
Only the Studio edition can read RAW image files and Adobe DNG files. 
The Studio edition allows you to select multiple files using the file browser to set up a list of files to work through.  This speeds up your work-flow, since you can use a single command after enhancing each image to save the result and load the next one.
Enhancing skin only

If there is no face in the picture, press the Enhance Skin Only button.  When you press this button, you will then be asked to select the skin area by painting over it using brush tools.

This option is only intended to be used if you want to use the skin enhancing when there is no face in the picture.  If there is a face, you will get much better results if you select the gender and follow the usual steps to position the lines over the face.  This will also usually be quicker since the skin area will be automatically selected.

If the Enhance Skin Only button is not shown, you need to enable it using the Show "Enhance Skin Only" Button checkbox in the General Settings dialog.

Adjust the image orientation

If your image is not the right way up, click on one of the buttons at the bottom of the controls panel. This will rotate your image in the direction shown by the arrows.

Note that you need to change the orientation before selecting the gender, since Portrait Professional automatically advances to the next step when you select the gender.
Locating the feature points

In the controls panel you can see an example of which point you need to click on next, as an image and as a text description.

Click on the corresponding position in your image.

If you hold down the mouse button when clicking in your image, you can see a cross appear. You can then drag the mouse to reposition the cross.

The cross will have a small text label next to it to remind you which point you are locating. These labels can be turned off if you don't like them using the General Settings panel.

As soon as you release the mouse after clicking, Portrait Professional automatically asks you to select the next feature position.  However, if you want to adjust the positions of any of the points you have already located, you can click on them and drag them.

Profile views

If the face is viewed side on, press the Profile View button at the bottom of the control panel.

If you are not sure whether the face is being viewed in profile or not, the main test is whether you can see both eyes.  If you can't see one of the eyes due to the head being turned, press the Profile View button.

When you press the Profile View button, you will only need to locate one eye point, the nose tip, and one mouth point.
If you press the Skip button, you will go straight to the final stage where you can view the enhanced image.  However, some of the sliders (those that make changes that need the outline to be accurately placed) will not be available.

If you make any changes to the outline positions, the skip button will no longer be shown. You will then need to press the Next button instead, to go through the rest of the features as described below.

Note: if this button does not appear, make sure the option Show "Skip To Final Step" Button is checked on the General Settings dialog.  Also, once you start making any changes to the outline, the skip button becomes hidden.

Adjusting the outline
Adjusting the outline for each feature

Portrait Professional will take you to each of the features in turn so that you can check, and if necessary, adjust the positioning of the selected outline of each feature.

You should only need to spend a few seconds on this step as Portrait Professional does not need to have the positions marked completely accurately.  Generally the smaller the adjustments you make here, the better the results.
Once you have been through all the features, press the Next button one more time to start Portrait Professional processing your image. You will then be taken to the Enhance Image step, where the fun begins!

The features

The features are shown in the following order. 

Left eye and eyebrow

The left corner of the left eye is in the position you selected in the previous step, locating the main features.

You may want to adjust it now that the image is zoomed in more closely on the eye, along with the other points around the eye.

Two blue circles are shown inside the eye. The smaller circle should fit around the pupil (the black part in the middle of the eye). The larger circle should fit around the iris (the colored part of the eye). These circles are positioned automatically, so you will not usually need to adjust them. If they are in the wrong place, wait until the eye outline has been set before adjusting them since the circle positions may be fixed once the eye outline is correct.

If you do need to move the circles, click on the point in the center of the circles. This lets you reposition the circles.

If you click on the eye center point, two more points appear, one on each circle. These points let you adjust the sizes of the circles so that they fit around the pupil and iris respectively. The positions of these points around the circle don't matter, they are only used to set the sizes of the circles.

Depending on the shape of the eyebrow, it can be difficult to get the outline to fit around the eyebrow.  In these cases, it is best to not worry about it and just get the position roughly correct.  Even if you are able to get the outline to fit around the eyebrow reasonably well, if you had to move the points a lot to get it to fit, you may get a better result by moving the points less even if the eyebrow outline no longer goes around the eyebrow accurately.

Right eye and eyebrow

The same comments about the left eye and eyebrow apply to the right eye and eyebrow.

Nose and Mouth

When you get to this stage the Mouth Open Or Closed panel will appear, provided it has not been turned off in the General Settings. This panel has two buttons:
Press this button if the mouth of the face you are enhancing is open. You will then see four lines between the corners of the mouth. The top two should be positioned around the upper lip, and the bottom two around the lower lip. If the line along the bottom of the top lip is placed close to the line along the top of the bottom lip, you will see the line along the top of the bottom lip disappear leaving just the control point in the middle.  The mouth will then be treated as closed anyway.
you are used to pressing the spacebar to quickly move on to the next stage, note you can also use this to dismiss the dialog asking if the mouth is open or closed. If this happens, the mouth will be selected as being open. If the mouth is in fact shut, you can either press the Back button followed by the Next button, and the panel will appear again, or you can simply move the middle two lines together.
Face outline

The face outline does not need to be set accurately. The same rule applies here, that you will get the best results if you only move those points that need it, and move those as little as possible.

Try to avoid moving the face outline points around the face, just move them towards or away from the face.
After you have adjusted the outline around the face in your image, you are ready to start enhancing the image.

Viewing the result

You can choose whether you want to see the before and after image side by side, or whether you just want the enhanced image as large as possible. Use the tabs above the images to select which option you prefer.

Whichever option you use, you can always flip the enhanced after image back to the original to see the changes by pressing and holding the Enter key.

Changing the result

Portrait Professional will automatically enhance your image when you reach this stage. See Saved Sliders for how to configure this default enhancement.

You can change how the image is enhanced by moving the sliders in the Controls panel.

The sliders are grouped into sections that control various aspects of the face. When you first enter this stage, the Face Sculpt Controls and Skin Controls sections are open, and the others are closed. Sections can be opened or closed by clicking on their title button. This has a small triangle pointing down if the section is open, or right if the section is closed.

Try moving the Master Fade slider in each section to get an idea of the overall effect controlled by that section.

The lower sliders in each section give you finer control over the effect.

Portrait Professional also comes with a set of Saved Sliders settings, which set some or all of the sliders to pre-defined values to get a particular effect. You can go through these to see some of the types of enhancement possible for your photo.

Fixing problems

Most problems with the enhanced images are caused either by one or more sliders being pushed up too far, or by the skin or hair areas being wrong.

Use the Brush tools to fix the skin and hair areas.
When you select this command, the original image stored in the software is effectively replaced with the enhanced image you have just created. You are then taken back to the Select Gender stage so that you can go through the process again for another face in your image.

You can repeat this process as many times as you need until every face in the image has been enhanced.

IMPORTANT: Please note that when you select this command, the changes to enhance the current face are fixed. You will no longer be able to make changes to the way the current face is enhanced.

You therefore need to make sure you are completely finished with each face before moving on to the next one.
Portrait Professional is designed to enhance portrait photos.

However, if your photo includes other parts of the body, then you can use the skin enhancement tools on other parts of the skin that can be seen.

To do this, all you need to do is make sure that the Portrait Professional knows which parts of the photo are skin. This is done using the skin area tools, as described in Skin Area.

 
Examples of applications that can call Portrait Professional as a plug-in in this way are Adobe Photoshop, when using the Portrait Professional Photoshop plug-in, and Adobe Lightroom, when Portrait Professional has been set as the optional external editor.

 Internal format of RAR and ZIP archives created by WinRAR allows to store practically any number of files of practically any size. Actual limits depend on the file system and available memory. Some older file systems do not support files larger than 4 GB.

WinRAR allocates memory to store name and attributes of every archiving file. If quick open information is added, twice more memory is required to store file name and attributes. While concrete amount depends on a file name length in UTF-8 encoding, typically we can just add several hundred bytes per file to memory required for compression dictionary to estimate memory use when archiving. Also please take into account that 32 bit WinRAR cannot use more than 2 GB of memory. If you need to process a lot of files or use large dictionaries, 64 bit WinRAR may be preferable.


First, you need to run WinRAR. Double-click or press Enter on the WinRAR icon. You can also start it from the Windows "Start menu": enter "Programs" then "WinRAR" and then run the "WinRAR" item.

When WinRAR is running, it displays a list of files and folders in the current folder. You need to go to the folder, which contains files to archive. You may use Ctrl+D, the disks list below the toolbar or click on the small disk icon in the bottom left corner, to change the current disk. Press BS, Ctrl+PgUp, small "Up" button below the toolbar or double-click on the folder named  to go to the parent folder. Press Enter, Ctrl+PgDn or double-click on any other folder to enter that folder. Ctrl+\ will set the root disk or archive folder as the current folder.

When you have entered the folder with the desired files, select the files and folders, which you are going to archive. This may be achieved by using Shift + arrow keys or the mouse as in Windows Explorer and other Windows programs. It is also possible, in WinRAR, to select files using Space or Ins keys. keys on the numeric keypad allow the selection of groups of files using file masks.

Having selected one or more files, click on the Add button at the top of the WinRAR window, press Alt+A or select the "Add files to archive" command in the Commands menu. Enter the destination archive name in the dialog box which appears or simply accept the default name. You may select, in this dialog, the format of the new archive ( RAR or ZIP) compression level, volume size and other archiving parameters. This dialog described in details in Archive name and parameters dialog topic. Click on the OK button when you are ready to create the archive.

During the archiving process, a window will be displayed showing operation statistics. If you wish to break the archiving process, click on the Cancel button in the command window. You may press the "Background" button in this window to minimize WinRAR to the tray. When archiving is completed, the command window disappears and the newly created archive becomes the currently selected file.

It is also possible to add files, to an existing RAR archive, using drag-and-drop. Select the desired archive in the WinRAR window and press Enter (or double click) on its name. RAR will read the archive and display its contents. You may now add files to the archive by simply dragging them from another program and dropping to WinRAR.

Chermak emphasized the importance of formally establishing a partnership structure so that when local union and contractor officials change, the partnership program remains.


Two men in a smoking-room were talking of their private-school days. "At our
school" said  "we had a ghost's footmark on the staircase. "

  " What was it like"

  "Oh, very unconvincing. Just the shape of a shoe, with a square toe, if I
remember right. The staircase was a stone one. I never heard any story about
the thing. That seems odd, when you come to think of it. Why didn't somebody
invent one, I wonder"

  "You never can tell with little boys. They have a mythology of their own.
There's a subject for you, by the way - "The Folklore of Private Schools"

  "Yes; the crop is rather scanty, though. I imagine, if you were to
investigate the cycle of ghost stories, for instance, which the boys at
private schools tell each other, they would all turn out to be
highly-compressed versions of stories out of books"

  "Nowadays the Strand and Pearson's, and so on, would be extensively drawn
upon"

  "No doubt: they weren't born or thought of in my time. Let's see. I
wonder if I can remember the staple ones that I was told. First, there was
the house with a room in which a series of people insisted on passing a
night; and each of them in the morning was found kneeling in a corner, and
had just time to say, 'I seen it' and died"

  "Wasn't that the house in Berkeley Square"

  "I dare say it was. Then there was the man who heard a noise in the
passage at night, opened his door, and saw someone crawling towards him on
all fours with his eye hanging out on his cheek. There was besides, let me
think - Yes! the room where a man was found dead in bed with a horseshoe
mark on his forehead, and the floor under the bed was covered with marks of
horseshoes also; I don't know why. Also there was the lady who, on locking
her bedroom door in a strange house, heard a thin voice among the
bed-curtains say, 'Now we're shut in for the night' None of those had any
explanation or sequel. I wonder if they go on still, those stories"

  "Oh, likely enough - with additions from the magazines, as I said. You
never heard, did you, of a real ghost at a private school? I thought not,
nobody has that ever I came across"

  "From the way in which you said that, I gather that you have"

  "I really don't know, but this is what was in my mind. It happened at my
private school thirty odd years ago, and I haven't any explanation of it.

  "The school I mean was near London. It was established in a large and
fairly old house - a great white building with very fine grounds about it;
there were large cedars in the garden, as there are in so many of the older
gardens in the Thames valley, and ancient elms in the three or four fields
which we used for our games. I think probably it was quite an attractive
place, but boys seldom allow that their schools possess any tolerable
features.

  "I came to the school in a September, soon after the year  and among
the boys who arrived on the same day was one whom I took to: a Highland boy,
whom I will call McLeod. I needn't spend time in describing him: the main
thing is that I got to know him very well. He was not an exceptional boy in
any way - not particularly good at books or games - but he suited me.

  "The school was a large one: there must have been from  boys
there as a rule, and so a considerable staff of masters was required, and
there were rather frequent changes among them.

  "One term - perhaps it was my third or fourth - a new master made his
appearance. His name was Sampson. He was a tallish, stoutish, pale,
black-bearded man. I think we liked him: he had travelled a good deal, and
had stories which amused us on our school walks, so that there was some
competition among us to get within earshot of him. I remember too - dear me,
I have hardly thought of it since then - that he had a charm on his
watch-chain that attracted my attention one day, and he let me examine it.
It was, I now suppose, a gold Byzantine coin; there was an effigy of some
absurd emperor on one side; the other side had been worn practically smooth,
and he had had cut on it - rather barbarously - his own initials,	
and a date, 24 July,  Yes, I can see it now: he told me he had picked
it up in Constantinople: it was about the size of a florin, perhaps rather
smaller.

  "Well, the first odd thing that happened was this. Sampson was doing
Latin grammar with us. One of his favourite methods - perhaps it is rather a
good one - was to make us construct sentences out of our own heads to
illustrate the rules he was trying to make us learn. Of course that is a
thing which gives a silly boy a chance of being impertinent: there are lots
of school stories in which that happens - or any-how there might be. But
Sampson was too good a disciplinarian for us to think of trying that on with
him. Now, on this occasion he was telling us how to express remembering in
Latin: and he ordered us each to make a sentence bringing in the verb
memini, 'I remember' Well, most of us made up some ordinary sentence such
as 'I remember my father, or 'He remembers his book' or something equally
uninteresting: and I dare say a good many put down memino librum meum, and
so forth: but the boy I mentioned - McLeod - was evidently thinking of
something more elaborate than that. The rest of us wanted to have our
sentences passed, and get on to something else, so some kicked him under the
desk, and I, who was next to him, poked him and whispered to him to look
sharp. But he didn't seem to attend. I looked at his paper and saw he had
put down nothing at all. So I jogged him again harder than before and
upbraided him sharply for keeping us all waiting. That did have some effect.
He started and seemed to wake up, and then very quickly he scribbled about a
couple of lines on his paper, and showed it up with the rest. As it was the
last, or nearly the last, to come in, and as Sampson had a good deal to say
to the boys who had written meminiscimus patri meo and the rest of it, it
turned out that the clock struck twelve before he had got to McLeod, and
McLeod had to wait afterwards to have his sentence corrected. There was
nothing much going on outside when I got out, so I waited for him to come.
He came very slowly when he did arrive, and I guessed there had been some
sort of trouble. 'Well,' I said, 'what did you get' 'Oh, I don't know'
said McLeod, 'nothing much: but I think Sampson's rather sick with me'
'Why, did you show him up some rot' 'No fear' he said. 'It was all right
as far as I could see: it was like this: Memento - that's right enough for
remember, and it takes a genitive, - memento putei inter quatuor taxos.'
'What silly rot' I said. 'What made you shove that down? What does it
mean' 'That's the funny part' said McLeod. not quite sure what it
does mean. All I know is, it just came into my head and I corked it down. I
know what I think it means, because just before I wrote it down I had a sort
of picture of it in my head: I believe it means "Remember the well among the
four" - what are those dark sort of trees that have red berries on them'
'Mountain ashes, I pose you mean' 'I never heard of them' said McLeod;
'no, I'll tell you - yews' 'Well, and what did Sampson say? 'Why, he was
jolly odd about it. When he read it he got up and went to the mantel-piece
and stopped quite a long time without saying anything, with his back to me.
And then he said, without turning round, and rather quiet, "What do you
suppose that means? I told him what I thought; only I couldn't remember the
name of the silly tree: and then he wanted to know why I put it down, and I
had to say something or other. And after that he left off talking about it,
and asked me how long I'd been here, and where my people lived, and things
like that: and then I came away: but he wasn't looking a bit well'

  "I don't remember any more that was said by either of us about this. Next
day McLeod took to his bed with a chill or something of the kind, and it was
a week or more before he was in school again. And as much as a month went by
without anything happening that was noticeable. Whether or not Mr. Sampson
was really startled, as McLeod had thought, he didn't show it. I am pretty
sure, of course, now, that there was something very curious in his past
history, but I'm not going to pretend that we boys were sharp enough to
guess any such thing.

  "There was one other incident of the same kind as the last which I told
you. Several times since that day we had had to make up examples in school
to illustrate different rules, but there had never been any row except when
we did them wrong. At last there came a day when we were going through those
dismal things which people call Conditional Sentences, and we were told to
make a conditional sentence, expressing a future consequence. We did it,
right or wrong, and showed up our bits of paper, and Sampson began looking
through them. All at once he got up, made some odd sort of noise in his
throat, and rushed out by a door that was just by his desk. We sat there for
a minute or two, and then - I suppose it was incorrect - but we went up, I
and one or two others, to look at the papers on his desk. Of course I
thought someone must have put down some nonsense or other, and Sampson had
gone off to report him. All the same, I noticed that he hadn't taken any of
the papers with him when he ran out. Well, the top paper on the desk was
written in red ink - which no one used - and it wasn't in anyone's hand who
was in the class. They all looked at it - McLeod and all - and took their
dying oaths that it wasn't theirs. Then I thought of counting the bits of
paper. And of this I made quite certain: that there were seventeen bits of
paper on the desk, and sixteen boys in the form. Well, I bagged the extra
paper, and kept it, and I believe I have it now. And now you will want to
know what was written on it. It was simple enough, and harmless enough, I
should have said.

  "Could you show me the paper" interrupted the listener.

  "Yes, I could: but there's another odd thing about it. That same
afternoon I took it out of my locker - I know for certain it was the same
bit, for I made a finger-mark on it and no single trace of writing of any
kind was there on it. I kept it, as I said, and since that time I have tried
various experiments to see whether sympathetic ink had been used, but
absolutely without result.

  "So much for that. After about half an hour Sampson looked in again: said
he had felt very unwell, and told us we might go. He came rather gingerly to
his desk, and gave just one look at the uppermost paper: and I suppose he
thought he must have been dreaming: anyhow, he asked no questions.

  "That day was a half-holiday, and next day Sampson was in school again,
much as usual. That night the third and last incident in my story happened.

  "We - McLeod and I - slept in a dormitory at right angles to the main
building. Sampson slept in the main building on the first floor. There was a
very bright full moon. At an hour which I can't tell exactly, but some time
between one and two, I was woken up by somebody shaking me. It was McLeod,
and a nice state of mind he seemed to be in. 'Come' he said, - 'come
there's a burglar getting in through Sampson's window' As soon as I could
speak, I said, 'Well, why not call out and wake everybody up? 'No, no' he
said, 'I'm not sure who it is: don't make a row: come and look' Naturally I
came and looked, and naturally there was no one there. I was cross enough,
and should have called McLeod plenty of names: only - I couldn't tell why -
it seemed to me that there was something wrong - something that made me very
glad I wasn't alone to face it. We were still at the window looking out, and
as soon as I could, I asked him what he had heard or seen. 'I didn't hear
anything at all' he said, 'but about five minutes before I woke you, I
found myself looking out of this window here, and there was a man sitting or
kneeling on Sampson's window-sill, and looking in, and I thought he was
beckoning' 'What sort of man' McLeod wriggled. 'I don't know' he said,
'but I can tell you one thing - he was beastly thin: and he looked as if he
was wet all over: and' he said, looking round and whispering as if he
hardly liked to hear himself, 'I'm not at all sure that he was alive'

  "We went on talking in whispers some time longer, and eventually crept
back to bed. No one else in the room woke or stirred the whole time. I
believe we did sleep a bit afterwards, but we were very cheap next day.

  "And next day Mr. Sampson was gone: not to be found: and I believe no
trace of him has ever come to light since. In thinking it over, one of the
oddest things about it all has seemed to me to be the fact that neither
McLeod nor I ever mentioned what we had seen to any third person whatever.
Of course no questions were asked on the subject, and if they had been, I am
inclined to believe that we could not have made any answer: we seemed unable
to speak about it.

  "That is my story" said the narrator. "The only approach to a ghost
story connected with a school that I know, but still, I think, an approach
to such a thing"

  The sequel to this may perhaps be reckoned highly conventional; but a
sequel there is, and so it must be produced. There had been more than one
listener to the story, and, in the latter part of that same year, or of the
next, one such listener was staying at a country house in Ireland.

  One evening his host was turning over a drawer full of odds and ends in
the smoking-room. Suddenly he put his hand upon a little box. "Now" he
said, "you know about old things; tell me what that is." My friend opened
the little box, and found in it a thin gold chain with an object attached to
it. He glanced at the object and then took off his spectacles to examine it
more narrowly. "What's the history of this" he asked. "Odd enough" was the
answer. "You know the yew thicket in the shrubbery: well, a year or two back
we were cleaning out the old well that used to be in the clearing here, and
what do you suppose we found"

  "Is it possible that you found a body? said the visitor, with an odd
feeling of nervousness.



Then the wolf was very angry indeed, and tried to get down the chimney in order to eat up the little pig. When the little pig saw what he was about, he put a pot full of water on the blazing fire, and, just as the wolf was coming down, he took off the cover, and in fell the wolf. Quickly the little pig clapped on the cover, and when the wolf was boiled ate him for supper.

said the wolf. As usual the little pig went off before the time, and got to the fair, and bought a butter-churn, which he was rolling home when he saw the wolf coming. So he got into the churn to hide, and in so doing turned it round, and it rolled down the hill with the pig in it, which frightened the wolf so much that he ran home without going to the fair. He went to the little pig's house, and told him how frightened he had been by a great round thing which came past him down the hill. Then the little pig said.
apples, hoping to get back before the wolf came; but it took long to climb the tree, and just as he was coming down from it, he saw the wolf coming. When the wolf came up he said
And he threw it so far that, while the wolf was gone to pick it up, the little pig jumped down and ran home. The next day the wolf came again, and said to the little pig
The little pig said: "Ready! I have been and come back again, and got a nice potful for dinner"
So he huffed, and he puffed, and he huffed, and he puffed, and he puffed and huffed; but he could NOT get the house down. Finding that he could not, with all his huffing and puffing, blow the house down, he said Once upon a time there were three little pigs, who went from home to seek their fortune. The first that went off met a man with a bundle of straw, and said to him The Story of the Three Little Pigs. 


Portrait Professional is the easiest and fastest way to re-touch portraits in just five easy steps, allowing you to achieve professional results in minutes.

Portrait Professional works in a completely different way to ordinary airbrushing and photo editing software normally used by the pros. Portrait Professional has been trained with hundreds of examples of human beauty, and as a result you can add as much or as little photo enhancement as required - by simply moving sliders. 

In fact due to the innate knowledge of human beauty built into Portrait Professional, the highest quality photo touch-up can be achieved by anyone in just a few minutes.

Portrait Professional is available in three editions, Standard, Studio and Studio64. All editions are covered by this manual.

Portrait Professional is available for Windows and Mac computers.  This manual is for the Windows version.
Click on the female or male button to let Portrait Professional know whether the face is a female or male face.

If the image is not the right way up, click on the orientation button that matches the orientation of your image to rotate your image. The orientation buttons are at the bottom of the controls panel.
Portrait Professional will guide you through each step but have a look at the quick start guide below to familiarize yourself with the stages.
The Adjust The Outline stage shouldn't take you very long.

You don't need to painstakingly position every point. In fact, you will get better results if you don't.

The only points that need to be accurately positioned are those around the eyes and mouth. For other points, if it is automatically placed in roughly the right place, resist the urge to make tiny changes to its position.
When adjusting the outline, move points as little as possible to get them to the right place.

For example, when moving the points around the mouth, or around the face, just move them in or out to get them on the perimeter. Try to avoid moving the points around the perimeter.

The exception is corner points. The points at the corners of the eyes, or the corners of the mouth must go in the right place.
Don't push the sliders up too far

Often, you can greatly improve a picture with fairly subtle changes.

Push the sliders up just far enough to get the results you want.

If you go too far, the result can look unnatural or faked.

Don't use the sliders to fix small blemishes
You can avoid the need to push the sliders up too far by using the Touch-Up tool to clean up spots and blemishes. This is better than pushing the sliders further up because that affects the whole face.

Make sure the skin area is right

Portrait Professional automatically works out which areas in your picture are skin. However, the automatic area selected can sometimes be adjusted to improve the results.

Use the skin Extend and Cut Back tools to paint over any skin areas that are wrong.
The Studio edition comes with a Photoshop plug-in component.  This allows you to open an image in Portrait Professional Studio directly from within Photoshop. When you have finished enhancing the image in Portrait Professional, the result is automatically loaded back into Photoshop.
Only the Studio edition can read RAW image files and Adobe DNG files. 
The Studio edition allows you to select multiple files using the file browser to set up a list of files to work through.  This speeds up your work-flow, since you can use a single command after enhancing each image to save the result and load the next one.
Enhancing skin only

If there is no face in the picture, press the Enhance Skin Only button.  When you press this button, you will then be asked to select the skin area by painting over it using brush tools.

This option is only intended to be used if you want to use the skin enhancing when there is no face in the picture.  If there is a face, you will get much better results if you select the gender and follow the usual steps to position the lines over the face.  This will also usually be quicker since the skin area will be automatically selected.

If the Enhance Skin Only button is not shown, you need to enable it using the Show "Enhance Skin Only" Button checkbox in the General Settings dialog.

Adjust the image orientation

If your image is not the right way up, click on one of the buttons at the bottom of the controls panel. This will rotate your image in the direction shown by the arrows.

Note that you need to change the orientation before selecting the gender, since Portrait Professional automatically advances to the next step when you select the gender.
Locating the feature points

In the controls panel you can see an example of which point you need to click on next, as an image and as a text description.

Click on the corresponding position in your image.

If you hold down the mouse button when clicking in your image, you can see a cross appear. You can then drag the mouse to reposition the cross.

The cross will have a small text label next to it to remind you which point you are locating. These labels can be turned off if you don't like them using the General Settings panel.

As soon as you release the mouse after clicking, Portrait Professional automatically asks you to select the next feature position.  However, if you want to adjust the positions of any of the points you have already located, you can click on them and drag them.

Profile views

If the face is viewed side on, press the Profile View button at the bottom of the control panel.

If you are not sure whether the face is being viewed in profile or not, the main test is whether you can see both eyes.  If you can't see one of the eyes due to the head being turned, press the Profile View button.

When you press the Profile View button, you will only need to locate one eye point, the nose tip, and one mouth point.
If you press the Skip button, you will go straight to the final stage where you can view the enhanced image.  However, some of the sliders (those that make changes that need the outline to be accurately placed) will not be available.

If you make any changes to the outline positions, the skip button will no longer be shown. You will then need to press the Next button instead, to go through the rest of the features as described below.

Note: if this button does not appear, make sure the option Show "Skip To Final Step" Button is checked on the General Settings dialog.  Also, once you start making any changes to the outline, the skip button becomes hidden.

Adjusting the outline
Adjusting the outline for each feature

Portrait Professional will take you to each of the features in turn so that you can check, and if necessary, adjust the positioning of the selected outline of each feature.

You should only need to spend a few seconds on this step as Portrait Professional does not need to have the positions marked completely accurately.  Generally the smaller the adjustments you make here, the better the results.
Once you have been through all the features, press the Next button one more time to start Portrait Professional processing your image. You will then be taken to the Enhance Image step, where the fun begins!

The features

The features are shown in the following order. 

Left eye and eyebrow

The left corner of the left eye is in the position you selected in the previous step, locating the main features.

You may want to adjust it now that the image is zoomed in more closely on the eye, along with the other points around the eye.

Two blue circles are shown inside the eye. The smaller circle should fit around the pupil (the black part in the middle of the eye). The larger circle should fit around the iris (the colored part of the eye). These circles are positioned automatically, so you will not usually need to adjust them. If they are in the wrong place, wait until the eye outline has been set before adjusting them since the circle positions may be fixed once the eye outline is correct.

If you do need to move the circles, click on the point in the center of the circles. This lets you reposition the circles.

If you click on the eye center point, two more points appear, one on each circle. These points let you adjust the sizes of the circles so that they fit around the pupil and iris respectively. The positions of these points around the circle don't matter, they are only used to set the sizes of the circles.

Depending on the shape of the eyebrow, it can be difficult to get the outline to fit around the eyebrow.  In these cases, it is best to not worry about it and just get the position roughly correct.  Even if you are able to get the outline to fit around the eyebrow reasonably well, if you had to move the points a lot to get it to fit, you may get a better result by moving the points less even if the eyebrow outline no longer goes around the eyebrow accurately.

Right eye and eyebrow

The same comments about the left eye and eyebrow apply to the right eye and eyebrow.

Nose and Mouth

When you get to this stage the Mouth Open Or Closed panel will appear, provided it has not been turned off in the General Settings. This panel has two buttons:
Press this button if the mouth of the face you are enhancing is open. You will then see four lines between the corners of the mouth. The top two should be positioned around the upper lip, and the bottom two around the lower lip. If the line along the bottom of the top lip is placed close to the line along the top of the bottom lip, you will see the line along the top of the bottom lip disappear leaving just the control point in the middle.  The mouth will then be treated as closed anyway.
you are used to pressing the spacebar to quickly move on to the next stage, note you can also use this to dismiss the dialog asking if the mouth is open or closed. If this happens, the mouth will be selected as being open. If the mouth is in fact shut, you can either press the Back button followed by the Next button, and the panel will appear again, or you can simply move the middle two lines together.
Face outline

The face outline does not need to be set accurately. The same rule applies here, that you will get the best results if you only move those points that need it, and move those as little as possible.

Try to avoid moving the face outline points around the face, just move them towards or away from the face.
After you have adjusted the outline around the face in your image, you are ready to start enhancing the image.

Viewing the result

You can choose whether you want to see the before and after image side by side, or whether you just want the enhanced image as large as possible. Use the tabs above the images to select which option you prefer.

Whichever option you use, you can always flip the enhanced after image back to the original to see the changes by pressing and holding the Enter key.

Changing the result

Portrait Professional will automatically enhance your image when you reach this stage. See Saved Sliders for how to configure this default enhancement.

You can change how the image is enhanced by moving the sliders in the Controls panel.

The sliders are grouped into sections that control various aspects of the face. When you first enter this stage, the Face Sculpt Controls and Skin Controls sections are open, and the others are closed. Sections can be opened or closed by clicking on their title button. This has a small triangle pointing down if the section is open, or right if the section is closed.

Try moving the Master Fade slider in each section to get an idea of the overall effect controlled by that section.

The lower sliders in each section give you finer control over the effect.

Portrait Professional also comes with a set of Saved Sliders settings, which set some or all of the sliders to pre-defined values to get a particular effect. You can go through these to see some of the types of enhancement possible for your photo.

Fixing problems

Most problems with the enhanced images are caused either by one or more sliders being pushed up too far, or by the skin or hair areas being wrong.

Use the Brush tools to fix the skin and hair areas.
When you select this command, the original image stored in the software is effectively replaced with the enhanced image you have just created. You are then taken back to the Select Gender stage so that you can go through the process again for another face in your image.

You can repeat this process as many times as you need until every face in the image has been enhanced.

IMPORTANT: Please note that when you select this command, the changes to enhance the current face are fixed. You will no longer be able to make changes to the way the current face is enhanced.

You therefore need to make sure you are completely finished with each face before moving on to the next one.
Portrait Professional is designed to enhance portrait photos.

However, if your photo includes other parts of the body, then you can use the skin enhancement tools on other parts of the skin that can be seen.

To do this, all you need to do is make sure that the Portrait Professional knows which parts of the photo are skin. This is done using the skin area tools, as described in Skin Area.

 
Examples of applications that can call Portrait Professional as a plug-in in this way are Adobe Photoshop, when using the Portrait Professional Photoshop plug-in, and Adobe Lightroom, when Portrait Professional has been set as the optional external editor.

 Internal format of RAR and ZIP archives created by WinRAR allows to store practically any number of files of practically any size. Actual limits depend on the file system and available memory. Some older file systems do not support files larger than 4 GB.

WinRAR allocates memory to store name and attributes of every archiving file. If quick open information is added, twice more memory is required to store file name and attributes. While concrete amount depends on a file name length in UTF-8 encoding, typically we can just add several hundred bytes per file to memory required for compression dictionary to estimate memory use when archiving. Also please take into account that 32 bit WinRAR cannot use more than 2 GB of memory. If you need to process a lot of files or use large dictionaries, 64 bit WinRAR may be preferable.


First, you need to run WinRAR. Double-click or press Enter on the WinRAR icon. You can also start it from the Windows "Start menu": enter "Programs" then "WinRAR" and then run the "WinRAR" item.

When WinRAR is running, it displays a list of files and folders in the current folder. You need to go to the folder, which contains files to archive. You may use Ctrl+D, the disks list below the toolbar or click on the small disk icon in the bottom left corner, to change the current disk. Press BS, Ctrl+PgUp, small "Up" button below the toolbar or double-click on the folder named  to go to the parent folder. Press Enter, Ctrl+PgDn or double-click on any other folder to enter that folder. Ctrl+\ will set the root disk or archive folder as the current folder.

When you have entered the folder with the desired files, select the files and folders, which you are going to archive. This may be achieved by using Shift + arrow keys or the mouse as in Windows Explorer and other Windows programs. It is also possible, in WinRAR, to select files using Space or Ins keys. keys on the numeric keypad allow the selection of groups of files using file masks.

Having selected one or more files, click on the Add button at the top of the WinRAR window, press Alt+A or select the "Add files to archive" command in the Commands menu. Enter the destination archive name in the dialog box which appears or simply accept the default name. You may select, in this dialog, the format of the new archive ( RAR or ZIP) compression level, volume size and other archiving parameters. This dialog described in details in Archive name and parameters dialog topic. Click on the OK button when you are ready to create the archive.

During the archiving process, a window will be displayed showing operation statistics. If you wish to break the archiving process, click on the Cancel button in the command window. You may press the "Background" button in this window to minimize WinRAR to the tray. When archiving is completed, the command window disappears and the newly created archive becomes the currently selected file.

It is also possible to add files, to an existing RAR archive, using drag-and-drop. Select the desired archive in the WinRAR window and press Enter (or double click) on its name. RAR will read the archive and display its contents. You may now add files to the archive by simply dragging them from another program and dropping to WinRAR.

Two men in a smoking-room were talking of their private-school days. "At our
school" said  "we had a ghost's footmark on the staircase. "

  " What was it like"

  "Oh, very unconvincing. Just the shape of a shoe, with a square toe, if I
remember right. The staircase was a stone one. I never heard any story about
the thing. That seems odd, when you come to think of it. Why didn't somebody
invent one, I wonder"

  "You never can tell with little boys. They have a mythology of their own.
There's a subject for you, by the way - "The Folklore of Private Schools"

  "Yes; the crop is rather scanty, though. I imagine, if you were to
investigate the cycle of ghost stories, for instance, which the boys at
private schools tell each other, they would all turn out to be
highly-compressed versions of stories out of books"

  "Nowadays the Strand and Pearson's, and so on, would be extensively drawn
upon"

  "No doubt: they weren't born or thought of in my time. Let's see. I
wonder if I can remember the staple ones that I was told. First, there was
the house with a room in which a series of people insisted on passing a
night; and each of them in the morning was found kneeling in a corner, and
had just time to say, 'I seen it' and died"

  "Wasn't that the house in Berkeley Square"

  "I dare say it was. Then there was the man who heard a noise in the
passage at night, opened his door, and saw someone crawling towards him on
all fours with his eye hanging out on his cheek. There was besides, let me
think - Yes! the room where a man was found dead in bed with a horseshoe
mark on his forehead, and the floor under the bed was covered with marks of
horseshoes also; I don't know why. Also there was the lady who, on locking
her bedroom door in a strange house, heard a thin voice among the
bed-curtains say, 'Now we're shut in for the night' None of those had any
explanation or sequel. I wonder if they go on still, those stories"

  "Oh, likely enough - with additions from the magazines, as I said. You
never heard, did you, of a real ghost at a private school? I thought not,
nobody has that ever I came across"

  "From the way in which you said that, I gather that you have"

  "I really don't know, but this is what was in my mind. It happened at my
private school thirty odd years ago, and I haven't any explanation of it.

  "The school I mean was near London. It was established in a large and
fairly old house - a great white building with very fine grounds about it;
there were large cedars in the garden, as there are in so many of the older
gardens in the Thames valley, and ancient elms in the three or four fields
which we used for our games. I think probably it was quite an attractive
place, but boys seldom allow that their schools possess any tolerable
features.

  "I came to the school in a September, soon after the year  and among
the boys who arrived on the same day was one whom I took to: a Highland boy,
whom I will call McLeod. I needn't spend time in describing him: the main
thing is that I got to know him very well. He was not an exceptional boy in
any way - not particularly good at books or games - but he suited me.

  "The school was a large one: there must have been from  boys
there as a rule, and so a considerable staff of masters was required, and
there were rather frequent changes among them.

  "One term - perhaps it was my third or fourth - a new master made his
appearance. His name was Sampson. He was a tallish, stoutish, pale,
black-bearded man. I think we liked him: he had travelled a good deal, and
had stories which amused us on our school walks, so that there was some
competition among us to get within earshot of him. I remember too - dear me,
I have hardly thought of it since then - that he had a charm on his
watch-chain that attracted my attention one day, and he let me examine it.
It was, I now suppose, a gold Byzantine coin; there was an effigy of some
absurd emperor on one side; the other side had been worn practically smooth,
and he had had cut on it - rather barbarously - his own initials,	
and a date, 24 July,  Yes, I can see it now: he told me he had picked
it up in Constantinople: it was about the size of a florin, perhaps rather
smaller.

  "Well, the first odd thing that happened was this. Sampson was doing
Latin grammar with us. One of his favourite methods - perhaps it is rather a
good one - was to make us construct sentences out of our own heads to
illustrate the rules he was trying to make us learn. Of course that is a
thing which gives a silly boy a chance of being impertinent: there are lots
of school stories in which that happens - or any-how there might be. But
Sampson was too good a disciplinarian for us to think of trying that on with
him. Now, on this occasion he was telling us how to express remembering in
Latin: and he ordered us each to make a sentence bringing in the verb
memini, 'I remember' Well, most of us made up some ordinary sentence such
as 'I remember my father, or 'He remembers his book' or something equally
uninteresting: and I dare say a good many put down memino librum meum, and
so forth: but the boy I mentioned - McLeod - was evidently thinking of
something more elaborate than that. The rest of us wanted to have our
sentences passed, and get on to something else, so some kicked him under the
desk, and I, who was next to him, poked him and whispered to him to look
sharp. But he didn't seem to attend. I looked at his paper and saw he had
put down nothing at all. So I jogged him again harder than before and
upbraided him sharply for keeping us all waiting. That did have some effect.
He started and seemed to wake up, and then very quickly he scribbled about a
couple of lines on his paper, and showed it up with the rest. As it was the
last, or nearly the last, to come in, and as Sampson had a good deal to say
to the boys who had written meminiscimus patri meo and the rest of it, it
turned out that the clock struck twelve before he had got to McLeod, and
McLeod had to wait afterwards to have his sentence corrected. There was
nothing much going on outside when I got out, so I waited for him to come.
He came very slowly when he did arrive, and I guessed there had been some
sort of trouble. 'Well,' I said, 'what did you get' 'Oh, I don't know'
said McLeod, 'nothing much: but I think Sampson's rather sick with me'
'Why, did you show him up some rot' 'No fear' he said. 'It was all right
as far as I could see: it was like this: Memento - that's right enough for
remember, and it takes a genitive, - memento putei inter quatuor taxos.'
'What silly rot' I said. 'What made you shove that down? What does it
mean' 'That's the funny part' said McLeod. not quite sure what it
does mean. All I know is, it just came into my head and I corked it down. I
know what I think it means, because just before I wrote it down I had a sort
of picture of it in my head: I believe it means "Remember the well among the
four" - what are those dark sort of trees that have red berries on them'
'Mountain ashes, I pose you mean' 'I never heard of them' said McLeod;
'no, I'll tell you - yews' 'Well, and what did Sampson say? 'Why, he was
jolly odd about it. When he read it he got up and went to the mantel-piece
and stopped quite a long time without saying anything, with his back to me.
And then he said, without turning round, and rather quiet, "What do you
suppose that means? I told him what I thought; only I couldn't remember the
name of the silly tree: and then he wanted to know why I put it down, and I
had to say something or other. And after that he left off talking about it,
and asked me how long I'd been here, and where my people lived, and things
like that: and then I came away: but he wasn't looking a bit well'

  "I don't remember any more that was said by either of us about this. Next
day McLeod took to his bed with a chill or something of the kind, and it was
a week or more before he was in school again. And as much as a month went by
without anything happening that was noticeable. Whether or not Mr. Sampson
was really startled, as McLeod had thought, he didn't show it. I am pretty
sure, of course, now, that there was something very curious in his past
history, but I'm not going to pretend that we boys were sharp enough to
guess any such thing.

  "There was one other incident of the same kind as the last which I told
you. Several times since that day we had had to make up examples in school
to illustrate different rules, but there had never been any row except when
we did them wrong. At last there came a day when we were going through those
dismal things which people call Conditional Sentences, and we were told to
make a conditional sentence, expressing a future consequence. We did it,
right or wrong, and showed up our bits of paper, and Sampson began looking
through them. All at once he got up, made some odd sort of noise in his
throat, and rushed out by a door that was just by his desk. We sat there for
a minute or two, and then - I suppose it was incorrect - but we went up, I
and one or two others, to look at the papers on his desk. Of course I
thought someone must have put down some nonsense or other, and Sampson had
gone off to report him. All the same, I noticed that he hadn't taken any of
the papers with him when he ran out. Well, the top paper on the desk was
written in red ink - which no one used - and it wasn't in anyone's hand who
was in the class. They all looked at it - McLeod and all - and took their
dying oaths that it wasn't theirs. Then I thought of counting the bits of
paper. And of this I made quite certain: that there were seventeen bits of
paper on the desk, and sixteen boys in the form. Well, I bagged the extra
paper, and kept it, and I believe I have it now. And now you will want to
know what was written on it. It was simple enough, and harmless enough, I
should have said.

  "Could you show me the paper" interrupted the listener.

  "Yes, I could: but there's another odd thing about it. That same
afternoon I took it out of my locker - I know for certain it was the same
bit, for I made a finger-mark on it and no single trace of writing of any
kind was there on it. I kept it, as I said, and since that time I have tried
various experiments to see whether sympathetic ink had been used, but
absolutely without result.

  "So much for that. After about half an hour Sampson looked in again: said
he had felt very unwell, and told us we might go. He came rather gingerly to
his desk, and gave just one look at the uppermost paper: and I suppose he
thought he must have been dreaming: anyhow, he asked no questions.

  "That day was a half-holiday, and next day Sampson was in school again,
much as usual. That night the third and last incident in my story happened.

  "We - McLeod and I - slept in a dormitory at right angles to the main
building. Sampson slept in the main building on the first floor. There was a
very bright full moon. At an hour which I can't tell exactly, but some time
between one and two, I was woken up by somebody shaking me. It was McLeod,
and a nice state of mind he seemed to be in. 'Come' he said, - 'come
there's a burglar getting in through Sampson's window' As soon as I could
speak, I said, 'Well, why not call out and wake everybody up? 'No, no' he
said, 'I'm not sure who it is: don't make a row: come and look' Naturally I
came and looked, and naturally there was no one there. I was cross enough,
and should have called McLeod plenty of names: only - I couldn't tell why -
it seemed to me that there was something wrong - something that made me very
glad I wasn't alone to face it. We were still at the window looking out, and
as soon as I could, I asked him what he had heard or seen. 'I didn't hear
anything at all' he said, 'but about five minutes before I woke you, I
found myself looking out of this window here, and there was a man sitting or
kneeling on Sampson's window-sill, and looking in, and I thought he was
beckoning' 'What sort of man' McLeod wriggled. 'I don't know' he said,
'but I can tell you one thing - he was beastly thin: and he looked as if he
was wet all over: and' he said, looking round and whispering as if he
hardly liked to hear himself, 'I'm not at all sure that he was alive'

  "We went on talking in whispers some time longer, and eventually crept
back to bed. No one else in the room woke or stirred the whole time. I
believe we did sleep a bit afterwards, but we were very cheap next day.

  "And next day Mr. Sampson was gone: not to be found: and I believe no
trace of him has ever come to light since. In thinking it over, one of the
oddest things about it all has seemed to me to be the fact that neither
McLeod nor I ever mentioned what we had seen to any third person whatever.
Of course no questions were asked on the subject, and if they had been, I am
inclined to believe that we could not have made any answer: we seemed unable
to speak about it.

  "That is my story" said the narrator. "The only approach to a ghost
story connected with a school that I know, but still, I think, an approach
to such a thing"

  The sequel to this may perhaps be reckoned highly conventional; but a
sequel there is, and so it must be produced. There had been more than one
listener to the story, and, in the latter part of that same year, or of the
next, one such listener was staying at a country house in Ireland.

  One evening his host was turning over a drawer full of odds and ends in
the smoking-room. Suddenly he put his hand upon a little box. "Now" he
said, "you know about old things; tell me what that is." My friend opened
the little box, and found in it a thin gold chain with an object attached to
it. He glanced at the object and then took off his spectacles to examine it
more narrowly. "What's the history of this" he asked. "Odd enough" was the
answer. "You know the yew thicket in the shrubbery: well, a year or two back
we were cleaning out the old well that used to be in the clearing here, and
what do you suppose we found"

  "Is it possible that you found a body? said the visitor, with an odd
feeling of nervousness.



Then the wolf was very angry indeed, and tried to get down the chimney in order to eat up the little pig. When the little pig saw what he was about, he put a pot full of water on the blazing fire, and, just as the wolf was coming down, he took off the cover, and in fell the wolf. Quickly the little pig clapped on the cover, and when the wolf was boiled ate him for supper.

said the wolf. As usual the little pig went off before the time, and got to the fair, and bought a butter-churn, which he was rolling home when he saw the wolf coming. So he got into the churn to hide, and in so doing turned it round, and it rolled down the hill with the pig in it, which frightened the wolf so much that he ran home without going to the fair. He went to the little pig's house, and told him how frightened he had been by a great round thing which came past him down the hill. Then the little pig said.
apples, hoping to get back before the wolf came; but it took long to climb the tree, and just as he was coming down from it, he saw the wolf coming. When the wolf came up he said
And he threw it so far that, while the wolf was gone to pick it up, the little pig jumped down and ran home. The next day the wolf came again, and said to the little pig
The little pig said: "Ready! I have been and come back again, and got a nice potful for dinner"
So he huffed, and he puffed, and he huffed, and he puffed, and he puffed and huffed; but he could NOT get the house down. Finding that he could not, with all his huffing and puffing, blow the house down, he said Once upon a time there were three little pigs, who went from home to seek their fortune. The first that went off met a man with a bundle of straw, and said to him The Story of the Three Little Pigs. 


Portrait Professional is the easiest and fastest way to re-touch portraits in just five easy steps, allowing you to achieve professional results in minutes.

Portrait Professional works in a completely different way to ordinary airbrushing and photo editing software normally used by the pros. Portrait Professional has been trained with hundreds of examples of human beauty, and as a result you can add as much or as little photo enhancement as required - by simply moving sliders. 

In fact due to the innate knowledge of human beauty built into Portrait Professional, the highest quality photo touch-up can be achieved by anyone in just a few minutes.

Portrait Professional is available in three editions, Standard, Studio and Studio64. All editions are covered by this manual.

Portrait Professional is available for Windows and Mac computers.  This manual is for the Windows version.
Click on the female or male button to let Portrait Professional know whether the face is a female or male face.

If the image is not the right way up, click on the orientation button that matches the orientation of your image to rotate your image. The orientation buttons are at the bottom of the controls panel.
Portrait Professional will guide you through each step but have a look at the quick start guide below to familiarize yourself with the stages.
The Adjust The Outline stage shouldn't take you very long.

You don't need to painstakingly position every point. In fact, you will get better results if you don't.

The only points that need to be accurately positioned are those around the eyes and mouth. For other points, if it is automatically placed in roughly the right place, resist the urge to make tiny changes to its position.
When adjusting the outline, move points as little as possible to get them to the right place.

For example, when moving the points around the mouth, or around the face, just move them in or out to get them on the perimeter. Try to avoid moving the points around the perimeter.

The exception is corner points. The points at the corners of the eyes, or the corners of the mouth must go in the right place.
Don't push the sliders up too far

Often, you can greatly improve a picture with fairly subtle changes.

Push the sliders up just far enough to get the results you want.

If you go too far, the result can look unnatural or faked.

Don't use the sliders to fix small blemishes
You can avoid the need to push the sliders up too far by using the Touch-Up tool to clean up spots and blemishes. This is better than pushing the sliders further up because that affects the whole face.

Make sure the skin area is right

Portrait Professional automatically works out which areas in your picture are skin. However, the automatic area selected can sometimes be adjusted to improve the results.

Use the skin Extend and Cut Back tools to paint over any skin areas that are wrong.
The Studio edition comes with a Photoshop plug-in component.  This allows you to open an image in Portrait Professional Studio directly from within Photoshop. When you have finished enhancing the image in Portrait Professional, the result is automatically loaded back into Photoshop.
Only the Studio edition can read RAW image files and Adobe DNG files. 
The Studio edition allows you to select multiple files using the file browser to set up a list of files to work through.  This speeds up your work-flow, since you can use a single command after enhancing each image to save the result and load the next one.
Enhancing skin only

If there is no face in the picture, press the Enhance Skin Only button.  When you press this button, you will then be asked to select the skin area by painting over it using brush tools.

This option is only intended to be used if you want to use the skin enhancing when there is no face in the picture.  If there is a face, you will get much better results if you select the gender and follow the usual steps to position the lines over the face.  This will also usually be quicker since the skin area will be automatically selected.

If the Enhance Skin Only button is not shown, you need to enable it using the Show "Enhance Skin Only" Button checkbox in the General Settings dialog.

Adjust the image orientation

If your image is not the right way up, click on one of the buttons at the bottom of the controls panel. This will rotate your image in the direction shown by the arrows.

Note that you need to change the orientation before selecting the gender, since Portrait Professional automatically advances to the next step when you select the gender.
Locating the feature points

In the controls panel you can see an example of which point you need to click on next, as an image and as a text description.

Click on the corresponding position in your image.

If you hold down the mouse button when clicking in your image, you can see a cross appear. You can then drag the mouse to reposition the cross.

The cross will have a small text label next to it to remind you which point you are locating. These labels can be turned off if you don't like them using the General Settings panel.

As soon as you release the mouse after clicking, Portrait Professional automatically asks you to select the next feature position.  However, if you want to adjust the positions of any of the points you have already located, you can click on them and drag them.

Profile views

If the face is viewed side on, press the Profile View button at the bottom of the control panel.

If you are not sure whether the face is being viewed in profile or not, the main test is whether you can see both eyes.  If you can't see one of the eyes due to the head being turned, press the Profile View button.

When you press the Profile View button, you will only need to locate one eye point, the nose tip, and one mouth point.
If you press the Skip button, you will go straight to the final stage where you can view the enhanced image.  However, some of the sliders (those that make changes that need the outline to be accurately placed) will not be available.

If you make any changes to the outline positions, the skip button will no longer be shown. You will then need to press the Next button instead, to go through the rest of the features as described below.

Note: if this button does not appear, make sure the option Show "Skip To Final Step" Button is checked on the General Settings dialog.  Also, once you start making any changes to the outline, the skip button becomes hidden.

Adjusting the outline
Adjusting the outline for each feature

Portrait Professional will take you to each of the features in turn so that you can check, and if necessary, adjust the positioning of the selected outline of each feature.

You should only need to spend a few seconds on this step as Portrait Professional does not need to have the positions marked completely accurately.  Generally the smaller the adjustments you make here, the better the results.
Once you have been through all the features, press the Next button one more time to start Portrait Professional processing your image. You will then be taken to the Enhance Image step, where the fun begins!

The features

The features are shown in the following order. 

Left eye and eyebrow

The left corner of the left eye is in the position you selected in the previous step, locating the main features.

You may want to adjust it now that the image is zoomed in more closely on the eye, along with the other points around the eye.

Two blue circles are shown inside the eye. The smaller circle should fit around the pupil (the black part in the middle of the eye). The larger circle should fit around the iris (the colored part of the eye). These circles are positioned automatically, so you will not usually need to adjust them. If they are in the wrong place, wait until the eye outline has been set before adjusting them since the circle positions may be fixed once the eye outline is correct.

If you do need to move the circles, click on the point in the center of the circles. This lets you reposition the circles.

If you click on the eye center point, two more points appear, one on each circle. These points let you adjust the sizes of the circles so that they fit around the pupil and iris respectively. The positions of these points around the circle don't matter, they are only used to set the sizes of the circles.

Depending on the shape of the eyebrow, it can be difficult to get the outline to fit around the eyebrow.  In these cases, it is best to not worry about it and just get the position roughly correct.  Even if you are able to get the outline to fit around the eyebrow reasonably well, if you had to move the points a lot to get it to fit, you may get a better result by moving the points less even if the eyebrow outline no longer goes around the eyebrow accurately.

Right eye and eyebrow

The same comments about the left eye and eyebrow apply to the right eye and eyebrow.

Nose and Mouth

When you get to this stage the Mouth Open Or Closed panel will appear, provided it has not been turned off in the General Settings. This panel has two buttons:
Press this button if the mouth of the face you are enhancing is open. You will then see four lines between the corners of the mouth. The top two should be positioned around the upper lip, and the bottom two around the lower lip. If the line along the bottom of the top lip is placed close to the line along the top of the bottom lip, you will see the line along the top of the bottom lip disappear leaving just the control point in the middle.  The mouth will then be treated as closed anyway.
you are used to pressing the spacebar to quickly move on to the next stage, note you can also use this to dismiss the dialog asking if the mouth is open or closed. If this happens, the mouth will be selected as being open. If the mouth is in fact shut, you can either press the Back button followed by the Next button, and the panel will appear again, or you can simply move the middle two lines together.
Face outline

The face outline does not need to be set accurately. The same rule applies here, that you will get the best results if you only move those points that need it, and move those as little as possible.

Try to avoid moving the face outline points around the face, just move them towards or away from the face.
After you have adjusted the outline around the face in your image, you are ready to start enhancing the image.

Viewing the result

You can choose whether you want to see the before and after image side by side, or whether you just want the enhanced image as large as possible. Use the tabs above the images to select which option you prefer.

Whichever option you use, you can always flip the enhanced after image back to the original to see the changes by pressing and holding the Enter key.

Changing the result

Portrait Professional will automatically enhance your image when you reach this stage. See Saved Sliders for how to configure this default enhancement.

You can change how the image is enhanced by moving the sliders in the Controls panel.

The sliders are grouped into sections that control various aspects of the face. When you first enter this stage, the Face Sculpt Controls and Skin Controls sections are open, and the others are closed. Sections can be opened or closed by clicking on their title button. This has a small triangle pointing down if the section is open, or right if the section is closed.

Try moving the Master Fade slider in each section to get an idea of the overall effect controlled by that section.

The lower sliders in each section give you finer control over the effect.

Portrait Professional also comes with a set of Saved Sliders settings, which set some or all of the sliders to pre-defined values to get a particular effect. You can go through these to see some of the types of enhancement possible for your photo.

Fixing problems

Most problems with the enhanced images are caused either by one or more sliders being pushed up too far, or by the skin or hair areas being wrong.

Use the Brush tools to fix the skin and hair areas.
When you select this command, the original image stored in the software is effectively replaced with the enhanced image you have just created. You are then taken back to the Select Gender stage so that you can go through the process again for another face in your image.

You can repeat this process as many times as you need until every face in the image has been enhanced.

IMPORTANT: Please note that when you select this command, the changes to enhance the current face are fixed. You will no longer be able to make changes to the way the current face is enhanced.

You therefore need to make sure you are completely finished with each face before moving on to the next one.
Portrait Professional is designed to enhance portrait photos.

However, if your photo includes other parts of the body, then you can use the skin enhancement tools on other parts of the skin that can be seen.

To do this, all you need to do is make sure that the Portrait Professional knows which parts of the photo are skin. This is done using the skin area tools, as described in Skin Area.

 
Examples of applications that can call Portrait Professional as a plug-in in this way are Adobe Photoshop, when using the Portrait Professional Photoshop plug-in, and Adobe Lightroom, when Portrait Professional has been set as the optional external editor.

 Internal format of RAR and ZIP archives created by WinRAR allows to store practically any number of files of practically any size. Actual limits depend on the file system and available memory. Some older file systems do not support files larger than 4 GB.

WinRAR allocates memory to store name and attributes of every archiving file. If quick open information is added, twice more memory is required to store file name and attributes. While concrete amount depends on a file name length in UTF-8 encoding, typically we can just add several hundred bytes per file to memory required for compression dictionary to estimate memory use when archiving. Also please take into account that 32 bit WinRAR cannot use more than 2 GB of memory. If you need to process a lot of files or use large dictionaries, 64 bit WinRAR may be preferable.


First, you need to run WinRAR. Double-click or press Enter on the WinRAR icon. You can also start it from the Windows "Start menu": enter "Programs" then "WinRAR" and then run the "WinRAR" item.

When WinRAR is running, it displays a list of files and folders in the current folder. You need to go to the folder, which contains files to archive. You may use Ctrl+D, the disks list below the toolbar or click on the small disk icon in the bottom left corner, to change the current disk. Press BS, Ctrl+PgUp, small "Up" button below the toolbar or double-click on the folder named  to go to the parent folder. Press Enter, Ctrl+PgDn or double-click on any other folder to enter that folder. Ctrl+\ will set the root disk or archive folder as the current folder.

When you have entered the folder with the desired files, select the files and folders, which you are going to archive. This may be achieved by using Shift + arrow keys or the mouse as in Windows Explorer and other Windows programs. It is also possible, in WinRAR, to select files using Space or Ins keys. keys on the numeric keypad allow the selection of groups of files using file masks.

Having selected one or more files, click on the Add button at the top of the WinRAR window, press Alt+A or select the "Add files to archive" command in the Commands menu. Enter the destination archive name in the dialog box which appears or simply accept the default name. You may select, in this dialog, the format of the new archive ( RAR or ZIP) compression level, volume size and other archiving parameters. This dialog described in details in Archive name and parameters dialog topic. Click on the OK button when you are ready to create the archive.

During the archiving process, a window will be displayed showing operation statistics. If you wish to break the archiving process, click on the Cancel button in the command window. You may press the "Background" button in this window to minimize WinRAR to the tray. When archiving is completed, the command window disappears and the newly created archive becomes the currently selected file.

It is also possible to add files, to an existing RAR archive, using drag-and-drop. Select the desired archive in the WinRAR window and press Enter (or double click) on its name. RAR will read the archive and display its contents. You may now add files to the archive by simply dragging them from another program and dropping to WinRAR.

Two men in a smoking-room were talking of their private-school days. "At our
school" said  "we had a ghost's footmark on the staircase. "

  " What was it like"

  "Oh, very unconvincing. Just the shape of a shoe, with a square toe, if I
remember right. The staircase was a stone one. I never heard any story about
the thing. That seems odd, when you come to think of it. Why didn't somebody
invent one, I wonder"

  "You never can tell with little boys. They have a mythology of their own.
There's a subject for you, by the way - "The Folklore of Private Schools"

  "Yes; the crop is rather scanty, though. I imagine, if you were to
investigate the cycle of ghost stories, for instance, which the boys at
private schools tell each other, they would all turn out to be
highly-compressed versions of stories out of books"

  "Nowadays the Strand and Pearson's, and so on, would be extensively drawn
upon"

  "No doubt: they weren't born or thought of in my time. Let's see. I
wonder if I can remember the staple ones that I was told. First, there was
the house with a room in which a series of people insisted on passing a
night; and each of them in the morning was found kneeling in a corner, and
had just time to say, 'I seen it' and died"

  "Wasn't that the house in Berkeley Square"

  "I dare say it was. Then there was the man who heard a noise in the
passage at night, opened his door, and saw someone crawling towards him on
all fours with his eye hanging out on his cheek. There was besides, let me
think - Yes! the room where a man was found dead in bed with a horseshoe
mark on his forehead, and the floor under the bed was covered with marks of
horseshoes also; I don't know why. Also there was the lady who, on locking
her bedroom door in a strange house, heard a thin voice among the
bed-curtains say, 'Now we're shut in for the night' None of those had any
explanation or sequel. I wonder if they go on still, those stories"

  "Oh, likely enough - with additions from the magazines, as I said. You
never heard, did you, of a real ghost at a private school? I thought not,
nobody has that ever I came across"

  "From the way in which you said that, I gather that you have"

  "I really don't know, but this is what was in my mind. It happened at my
private school thirty odd years ago, and I haven't any explanation of it.

  "The school I mean was near London. It was established in a large and
fairly old house - a great white building with very fine grounds about it;
there were large cedars in the garden, as there are in so many of the older
gardens in the Thames valley, and ancient elms in the three or four fields
which we used for our games. I think probably it was quite an attractive
place, but boys seldom allow that their schools possess any tolerable
features.

  "I came to the school in a September, soon after the year  and among
the boys who arrived on the same day was one whom I took to: a Highland boy,
whom I will call McLeod. I needn't spend time in describing him: the main
thing is that I got to know him very well. He was not an exceptional boy in
any way - not particularly good at books or games - but he suited me.

  "The school was a large one: there must have been from  boys
there as a rule, and so a considerable staff of masters was required, and
there were rather frequent changes among them.

  "One term - perhaps it was my third or fourth - a new master made his
appearance. His name was Sampson. He was a tallish, stoutish, pale,
black-bearded man. I think we liked him: he had travelled a good deal, and
had stories which amused us on our school walks, so that there was some
competition among us to get within earshot of him. I remember too - dear me,
I have hardly thought of it since then - that he had a charm on his
watch-chain that attracted my attention one day, and he let me examine it.
It was, I now suppose, a gold Byzantine coin; there was an effigy of some
absurd emperor on one side; the other side had been worn practically smooth,
and he had had cut on it - rather barbarously - his own initials,	
and a date, 24 July,  Yes, I can see it now: he told me he had picked
it up in Constantinople: it was about the size of a florin, perhaps rather
smaller.

  "Well, the first odd thing that happened was this. Sampson was doing
Latin grammar with us. One of his favourite methods - perhaps it is rather a
good one - was to make us construct sentences out of our own heads to
illustrate the rules he was trying to make us learn. Of course that is a
thing which gives a silly boy a chance of being impertinent: there are lots
of school stories in which that happens - or any-how there might be. But
Sampson was too good a disciplinarian for us to think of trying that on with
him. Now, on this occasion he was telling us how to express remembering in
Latin: and he ordered us each to make a sentence bringing in the verb
memini, 'I remember' Well, most of us made up some ordinary sentence such
as 'I remember my father, or 'He remembers his book' or something equally
uninteresting: and I dare say a good many put down memino librum meum, and
so forth: but the boy I mentioned - McLeod - was evidently thinking of
something more elaborate than that. The rest of us wanted to have our
sentences passed, and get on to something else, so some kicked him under the
desk, and I, who was next to him, poked him and whispered to him to look
sharp. But he didn't seem to attend. I looked at his paper and saw he had
put down nothing at all. So I jogged him again harder than before and
upbraided him sharply for keeping us all waiting. That did have some effect.
He started and seemed to wake up, and then very quickly he scribbled about a
couple of lines on his paper, and showed it up with the rest. As it was the
last, or nearly the last, to come in, and as Sampson had a good deal to say
to the boys who had written meminiscimus patri meo and the rest of it, it
turned out that the clock struck twelve before he had got to McLeod, and
McLeod had to wait afterwards to have his sentence corrected. There was
nothing much going on outside when I got out, so I waited for him to come.
He came very slowly when he did arrive, and I guessed there had been some
sort of trouble. 'Well,' I said, 'what did you get' 'Oh, I don't know'
said McLeod, 'nothing much: but I think Sampson's rather sick with me'
'Why, did you show him up some rot' 'No fear' he said. 'It was all right
as far as I could see: it was like this: Memento - that's right enough for
remember, and it takes a genitive, - memento putei inter quatuor taxos.'
'What silly rot' I said. 'What made you shove that down? What does it
mean' 'That's the funny part' said McLeod. not quite sure what it
does mean. All I know is, it just came into my head and I corked it down. I
know what I think it means, because just before I wrote it down I had a sort
of picture of it in my head: I believe it means "Remember the well among the
four" - what are those dark sort of trees that have red berries on them'
'Mountain ashes, I pose you mean' 'I never heard of them' said McLeod;
'no, I'll tell you - yews' 'Well, and what did Sampson say? 'Why, he was
jolly odd about it. When he read it he got up and went to the mantel-piece
and stopped quite a long time without saying anything, with his back to me.
And then he said, without turning round, and rather quiet, "What do you
suppose that means? I told him what I thought; only I couldn't remember the
name of the silly tree: and then he wanted to know why I put it down, and I
had to say something or other. And after that he left off talking about it,
and asked me how long I'd been here, and where my people lived, and things
like that: and then I came away: but he wasn't looking a bit well'

  "I don't remember any more that was said by either of us about this. Next
day McLeod took to his bed with a chill or something of the kind, and it was
a week or more before he was in school again. And as much as a month went by
without anything happening that was noticeable. Whether or not Mr. Sampson
was really startled, as McLeod had thought, he didn't show it. I am pretty
sure, of course, now, that there was something very curious in his past
history, but I'm not going to pretend that we boys were sharp enough to
guess any such thing.

  "There was one other incident of the same kind as the last which I told
you. Several times since that day we had had to make up examples in school
to illustrate different rules, but there had never been any row except when
we did them wrong. At last there came a day when we were going through those
dismal things which people call Conditional Sentences, and we were told to
make a conditional sentence, expressing a future consequence. We did it,
right or wrong, and showed up our bits of paper, and Sampson began looking
through them. All at once he got up, made some odd sort of noise in his
throat, and rushed out by a door that was just by his desk. We sat there for
a minute or two, and then - I suppose it was incorrect - but we went up, I
and one or two others, to look at the papers on his desk. Of course I
thought someone must have put down some nonsense or other, and Sampson had
gone off to report him. All the same, I noticed that he hadn't taken any of
the papers with him when he ran out. Well, the top paper on the desk was
written in red ink - which no one used - and it wasn't in anyone's hand who
was in the class. They all looked at it - McLeod and all - and took their
dying oaths that it wasn't theirs. Then I thought of counting the bits of
paper. And of this I made quite certain: that there were seventeen bits of
paper on the desk, and sixteen boys in the form. Well, I bagged the extra
paper, and kept it, and I believe I have it now. And now you will want to
know what was written on it. It was simple enough, and harmless enough, I
should have said.

  "Could you show me the paper" interrupted the listener.

  "Yes, I could: but there's another odd thing about it. That same
afternoon I took it out of my locker - I know for certain it was the same
bit, for I made a finger-mark on it and no single trace of writing of any
kind was there on it. I kept it, as I said, and since that time I have tried
various experiments to see whether sympathetic ink had been used, but
absolutely without result.

  "So much for that. After about half an hour Sampson looked in again: said
he had felt very unwell, and told us we might go. He came rather gingerly to
his desk, and gave just one look at the uppermost paper: and I suppose he
thought he must have been dreaming: anyhow, he asked no questions.

  "That day was a half-holiday, and next day Sampson was in school again,
much as usual. That night the third and last incident in my story happened.

  "We - McLeod and I - slept in a dormitory at right angles to the main
building. Sampson slept in the main building on the first floor. There was a
very bright full moon. At an hour which I can't tell exactly, but some time
between one and two, I was woken up by somebody shaking me. It was McLeod,
and a nice state of mind he seemed to be in. 'Come' he said, - 'come
there's a burglar getting in through Sampson's window' As soon as I could
speak, I said, 'Well, why not call out and wake everybody up? 'No, no' he
said, 'I'm not sure who it is: don't make a row: come and look' Naturally I
came and looked, and naturally there was no one there. I was cross enough,
and should have called McLeod plenty of names: only - I couldn't tell why -
it seemed to me that there was something wrong - something that made me very
glad I wasn't alone to face it. We were still at the window looking out, and
as soon as I could, I asked him what he had heard or seen. 'I didn't hear
anything at all' he said, 'but about five minutes before I woke you, I
found myself looking out of this window here, and there was a man sitting or
kneeling on Sampson's window-sill, and looking in, and I thought he was
beckoning' 'What sort of man' McLeod wriggled. 'I don't know' he said,
'but I can tell you one thing - he was beastly thin: and he looked as if he
was wet all over: and' he said, looking round and whispering as if he
hardly liked to hear himself, 'I'm not at all sure that he was alive'

  "We went on talking in whispers some time longer, and eventually crept
back to bed. No one else in the room woke or stirred the whole time. I
believe we did sleep a bit afterwards, but we were very cheap next day.

  "And next day Mr. Sampson was gone: not to be found: and I believe no
trace of him has ever come to light since. In thinking it over, one of the
oddest things about it all has seemed to me to be the fact that neither
McLeod nor I ever mentioned what we had seen to any third person whatever.
Of course no questions were asked on the subject, and if they had been, I am
inclined to believe that we could not have made any answer: we seemed unable
to speak about it.

  "That is my story" said the narrator. "The only approach to a ghost
story connected with a school that I know, but still, I think, an approach
to such a thing"

  The sequel to this may perhaps be reckoned highly conventional; but a
sequel there is, and so it must be produced. There had been more than one
listener to the story, and, in the latter part of that same year, or of the
next, one such listener was staying at a country house in Ireland.

  One evening his host was turning over a drawer full of odds and ends in
the smoking-room. Suddenly he put his hand upon a little box. "Now" he
said, "you know about old things; tell me what that is." My friend opened
the little box, and found in it a thin gold chain with an object attached to
it. He glanced at the object and then took off his spectacles to examine it
more narrowly. "What's the history of this" he asked. "Odd enough" was the
answer. "You know the yew thicket in the shrubbery: well, a year or two back
we were cleaning out the old well that used to be in the clearing here, and
what do you suppose we found"

  "Is it possible that you found a body? said the visitor, with an odd
feeling of nervousness.



Then the wolf was very angry indeed, and tried to get down the chimney in order to eat up the little pig. When the little pig saw what he was about, he put a pot full of water on the blazing fire, and, just as the wolf was coming down, he took off the cover, and in fell the wolf. Quickly the little pig clapped on the cover, and when the wolf was boiled ate him for supper.

said the wolf. As usual the little pig went off before the time, and got to the fair, and bought a butter-churn, which he was rolling home when he saw the wolf coming. So he got into the churn to hide, and in so doing turned it round, and it rolled down the hill with the pig in it, which frightened the wolf so much that he ran home without going to the fair. He went to the little pig's house, and told him how frightened he had been by a great round thing which came past him down the hill. Then the little pig said.
apples, hoping to get back before the wolf came; but it took long to climb the tree, and just as he was coming down from it, he saw the wolf coming. When the wolf came up he said
And he threw it so far that, while the wolf was gone to pick it up, the little pig jumped down and ran home. The next day the wolf came again, and said to the little pig
The little pig said: "Ready! I have been and come back again, and got a nice potful for dinner"
So he huffed, and he puffed, and he huffed, and he puffed, and he puffed and huffed; but he could NOT get the house down. Finding that he could not, with all his huffing and puffing, blow the house down, he said Once upon a time there were three little pigs, who went from home to seek their fortune. The first that went off met a man with a bundle of straw, and said to him The Story of the Three Little Pigs. 


Portrait Professional is the easiest and fastest way to re-touch portraits in just five easy steps, allowing you to achieve professional results in minutes.

Portrait Professional works in a completely different way to ordinary airbrushing and photo editing software normally used by the pros. Portrait Professional has been trained with hundreds of examples of human beauty, and as a result you can add as much or as little photo enhancement as required - by simply moving sliders. 

In fact due to the innate knowledge of human beauty built into Portrait Professional, the highest quality photo touch-up can be achieved by anyone in just a few minutes.

Portrait Professional is available in three editions, Standard, Studio and Studio64. All editions are covered by this manual.

Portrait Professional is available for Windows and Mac computers.  This manual is for the Windows version.
Click on the female or male button to let Portrait Professional know whether the face is a female or male face.

If the image is not the right way up, click on the orientation button that matches the orientation of your image to rotate your image. The orientation buttons are at the bottom of the controls panel.
Portrait Professional will guide you through each step but have a look at the quick start guide below to familiarize yourself with the stages.
The Adjust The Outline stage shouldn't take you very long.

You don't need to painstakingly position every point. In fact, you will get better results if you don't.

The only points that need to be accurately positioned are those around the eyes and mouth. For other points, if it is automatically placed in roughly the right place, resist the urge to make tiny changes to its position.
When adjusting the outline, move points as little as possible to get them to the right place.

For example, when moving the points around the mouth, or around the face, just move them in or out to get them on the perimeter. Try to avoid moving the points around the perimeter.

The exception is corner points. The points at the corners of the eyes, or the corners of the mouth must go in the right place.
Don't push the sliders up too far

Often, you can greatly improve a picture with fairly subtle changes.

Push the sliders up just far enough to get the results you want.

If you go too far, the result can look unnatural or faked.

Don't use the sliders to fix small blemishes
You can avoid the need to push the sliders up too far by using the Touch-Up tool to clean up spots and blemishes. This is better than pushing the sliders further up because that affects the whole face.

Make sure the skin area is right

Portrait Professional automatically works out which areas in your picture are skin. However, the automatic area selected can sometimes be adjusted to improve the results.

Use the skin Extend and Cut Back tools to paint over any skin areas that are wrong.
The Studio edition comes with a Photoshop plug-in component.  This allows you to open an image in Portrait Professional Studio directly from within Photoshop. When you have finished enhancing the image in Portrait Professional, the result is automatically loaded back into Photoshop.
Only the Studio edition can read RAW image files and Adobe DNG files. 
The Studio edition allows you to select multiple files using the file browser to set up a list of files to work through.  This speeds up your work-flow, since you can use a single command after enhancing each image to save the result and load the next one.
Enhancing skin only

If there is no face in the picture, press the Enhance Skin Only button.  When you press this button, you will then be asked to select the skin area by painting over it using brush tools.

This option is only intended to be used if you want to use the skin enhancing when there is no face in the picture.  If there is a face, you will get much better results if you select the gender and follow the usual steps to position the lines over the face.  This will also usually be quicker since the skin area will be automatically selected.

If the Enhance Skin Only button is not shown, you need to enable it using the Show "Enhance Skin Only" Button checkbox in the General Settings dialog.

Adjust the image orientation

If your image is not the right way up, click on one of the buttons at the bottom of the controls panel. This will rotate your image in the direction shown by the arrows.

Note that you need to change the orientation before selecting the gender, since Portrait Professional automatically advances to the next step when you select the gender.
Locating the feature points

In the controls panel you can see an example of which point you need to click on next, as an image and as a text description.

Click on the corresponding position in your image.

If you hold down the mouse button when clicking in your image, you can see a cross appear. You can then drag the mouse to reposition the cross.

The cross will have a small text label next to it to remind you which point you are locating. These labels can be turned off if you don't like them using the General Settings panel.

As soon as you release the mouse after clicking, Portrait Professional automatically asks you to select the next feature position.  However, if you want to adjust the positions of any of the points you have already located, you can click on them and drag them.

Profile views

If the face is viewed side on, press the Profile View button at the bottom of the control panel.

If you are not sure whether the face is being viewed in profile or not, the main test is whether you can see both eyes.  If you can't see one of the eyes due to the head being turned, press the Profile View button.

When you press the Profile View button, you will only need to locate one eye point, the nose tip, and one mouth point.
If you press the Skip button, you will go straight to the final stage where you can view the enhanced image.  However, some of the sliders (those that make changes that need the outline to be accurately placed) will not be available.

If you make any changes to the outline positions, the skip button will no longer be shown. You will then need to press the Next button instead, to go through the rest of the features as described below.

Note: if this button does not appear, make sure the option Show "Skip To Final Step" Button is checked on the General Settings dialog.  Also, once you start making any changes to the outline, the skip button becomes hidden.

Adjusting the outline
Adjusting the outline for each feature

Portrait Professional will take you to each of the features in turn so that you can check, and if necessary, adjust the positioning of the selected outline of each feature.

You should only need to spend a few seconds on this step as Portrait Professional does not need to have the positions marked completely accurately.  Generally the smaller the adjustments you make here, the better the results.
Once you have been through all the features, press the Next button one more time to start Portrait Professional processing your image. You will then be taken to the Enhance Image step, where the fun begins!

The features

The features are shown in the following order. 

Left eye and eyebrow

The left corner of the left eye is in the position you selected in the previous step, locating the main features.

You may want to adjust it now that the image is zoomed in more closely on the eye, along with the other points around the eye.

Two blue circles are shown inside the eye. The smaller circle should fit around the pupil (the black part in the middle of the eye). The larger circle should fit around the iris (the colored part of the eye). These circles are positioned automatically, so you will not usually need to adjust them. If they are in the wrong place, wait until the eye outline has been set before adjusting them since the circle positions may be fixed once the eye outline is correct.

If you do need to move the circles, click on the point in the center of the circles. This lets you reposition the circles.

If you click on the eye center point, two more points appear, one on each circle. These points let you adjust the sizes of the circles so that they fit around the pupil and iris respectively. The positions of these points around the circle don't matter, they are only used to set the sizes of the circles.

Depending on the shape of the eyebrow, it can be difficult to get the outline to fit around the eyebrow.  In these cases, it is best to not worry about it and just get the position roughly correct.  Even if you are able to get the outline to fit around the eyebrow reasonably well, if you had to move the points a lot to get it to fit, you may get a better result by moving the points less even if the eyebrow outline no longer goes around the eyebrow accurately.

Right eye and eyebrow

The same comments about the left eye and eyebrow apply to the right eye and eyebrow.

Nose and Mouth

When you get to this stage the Mouth Open Or Closed panel will appear, provided it has not been turned off in the General Settings. This panel has two buttons:
Press this button if the mouth of the face you are enhancing is open. You will then see four lines between the corners of the mouth. The top two should be positioned around the upper lip, and the bottom two around the lower lip. If the line along the bottom of the top lip is placed close to the line along the top of the bottom lip, you will see the line along the top of the bottom lip disappear leaving just the control point in the middle.  The mouth will then be treated as closed anyway.
you are used to pressing the spacebar to quickly move on to the next stage, note you can also use this to dismiss the dialog asking if the mouth is open or closed. If this happens, the mouth will be selected as being open. If the mouth is in fact shut, you can either press the Back button followed by the Next button, and the panel will appear again, or you can simply move the middle two lines together.
Face outline

The face outline does not need to be set accurately. The same rule applies here, that you will get the best results if you only move those points that need it, and move those as little as possible.

Try to avoid moving the face outline points around the face, just move them towards or away from the face.
After you have adjusted the outline around the face in your image, you are ready to start enhancing the image.

Viewing the result

You can choose whether you want to see the before and after image side by side, or whether you just want the enhanced image as large as possible. Use the tabs above the images to select which option you prefer.

Whichever option you use, you can always flip the enhanced after image back to the original to see the changes by pressing and holding the Enter key.

Changing the result

Portrait Professional will automatically enhance your image when you reach this stage. See Saved Sliders for how to configure this default enhancement.

You can change how the image is enhanced by moving the sliders in the Controls panel.

The sliders are grouped into sections that control various aspects of the face. When you first enter this stage, the Face Sculpt Controls and Skin Controls sections are open, and the others are closed. Sections can be opened or closed by clicking on their title button. This has a small triangle pointing down if the section is open, or right if the section is closed.

Try moving the Master Fade slider in each section to get an idea of the overall effect controlled by that section.

The lower sliders in each section give you finer control over the effect.

Portrait Professional also comes with a set of Saved Sliders settings, which set some or all of the sliders to pre-defined values to get a particular effect. You can go through these to see some of the types of enhancement possible for your photo.

Fixing problems

Most problems with the enhanced images are caused either by one or more sliders being pushed up too far, or by the skin or hair areas being wrong.

Use the Brush tools to fix the skin and hair areas.
When you select this command, the original image stored in the software is effectively replaced with the enhanced image you have just created. You are then taken back to the Select Gender stage so that you can go through the process again for another face in your image.

You can repeat this process as many times as you need until every face in the image has been enhanced.

IMPORTANT: Please note that when you select this command, the changes to enhance the current face are fixed. You will no longer be able to make changes to the way the current face is enhanced.

You therefore need to make sure you are completely finished with each face before moving on to the next one.
Portrait Professional is designed to enhance portrait photos.

However, if your photo includes other parts of the body, then you can use the skin enhancement tools on other parts of the skin that can be seen.

To do this, all you need to do is make sure that the Portrait Professional knows which parts of the photo are skin. This is done using the skin area tools, as described in Skin Area.

 
Examples of applications that can call Portrait Professional as a plug-in in this way are Adobe Photoshop, when using the Portrait Professional Photoshop plug-in, and Adobe Lightroom, when Portrait Professional has been set as the optional external editor.

 Internal format of RAR and ZIP archives created by WinRAR allows to store practically any number of files of practically any size. Actual limits depend on the file system and available memory. Some older file systems do not support files larger than 4 GB.

WinRAR allocates memory to store name and attributes of every archiving file. If quick open information is added, twice more memory is required to store file name and attributes. While concrete amount depends on a file name length in UTF-8 encoding, typically we can just add several hundred bytes per file to memory required for compression dictionary to estimate memory use when archiving. Also please take into account that 32 bit WinRAR cannot use more than 2 GB of memory. If you need to process a lot of files or use large dictionaries, 64 bit WinRAR may be preferable.


First, you need to run WinRAR. Double-click or press Enter on the WinRAR icon. You can also start it from the Windows "Start menu": enter "Programs" then "WinRAR" and then run the "WinRAR" item.

When WinRAR is running, it displays a list of files and folders in the current folder. You need to go to the folder, which contains files to archive. You may use Ctrl+D, the disks list below the toolbar or click on the small disk icon in the bottom left corner, to change the current disk. Press BS, Ctrl+PgUp, small "Up" button below the toolbar or double-click on the folder named  to go to the parent folder. Press Enter, Ctrl+PgDn or double-click on any other folder to enter that folder. Ctrl+\ will set the root disk or archive folder as the current folder.

When you have entered the folder with the desired files, select the files and folders, which you are going to archive. This may be achieved by using Shift + arrow keys or the mouse as in Windows Explorer and other Windows programs. It is also possible, in WinRAR, to select files using Space or Ins keys. keys on the numeric keypad allow the selection of groups of files using file masks.

Having selected one or more files, click on the Add button at the top of the WinRAR window, press Alt+A or select the "Add files to archive" command in the Commands menu. Enter the destination archive name in the dialog box which appears or simply accept the default name. You may select, in this dialog, the format of the new archive ( RAR or ZIP) compression level, volume size and other archiving parameters. This dialog described in details in Archive name and parameters dialog topic. Click on the OK button when you are ready to create the archive.

During the archiving process, a window will be displayed showing operation statistics. If you wish to break the archiving process, click on the Cancel button in the command window. You may press the "Background" button in this window to minimize WinRAR to the tray. When archiving is completed, the command window disappears and the newly created archive becomes the currently selected file.

It is also possible to add files, to an existing RAR archive, using drag-and-drop. Select the desired archive in the WinRAR window and press Enter (or double click) on its name. RAR will read the archive and display its contents. You may now add files to the archive by simply dragging them from another program and dropping to WinRAR.

Two men in a smoking-room were talking of their private-school days. "At our
school" said  "we had a ghost's footmark on the staircase. "

  " What was it like"

  "Oh, very unconvincing. Just the shape of a shoe, with a square toe, if I
remember right. The staircase was a stone one. I never heard any story about
the thing. That seems odd, when you come to think of it. Why didn't somebody
invent one, I wonder"

  "You never can tell with little boys. They have a mythology of their own.
There's a subject for you, by the way - "The Folklore of Private Schools"

  "Yes; the crop is rather scanty, though. I imagine, if you were to
investigate the cycle of ghost stories, for instance, which the boys at
private schools tell each other, they would all turn out to be
highly-compressed versions of stories out of books"

  "Nowadays the Strand and Pearson's, and so on, would be extensively drawn
upon"

  "No doubt: they weren't born or thought of in my time. Let's see. I
wonder if I can remember the staple ones that I was told. First, there was
the house with a room in which a series of people insisted on passing a
night; and each of them in the morning was found kneeling in a corner, and
had just time to say, 'I seen it' and died"

  "Wasn't that the house in Berkeley Square"

  "I dare say it was. Then there was the man who heard a noise in the
passage at night, opened his door, and saw someone crawling towards him on
all fours with his eye hanging out on his cheek. There was besides, let me
think - Yes! the room where a man was found dead in bed with a horseshoe
mark on his forehead, and the floor under the bed was covered with marks of
horseshoes also; I don't know why. Also there was the lady who, on locking
her bedroom door in a strange house, heard a thin voice among the
bed-curtains say, 'Now we're shut in for the night' None of those had any
explanation or sequel. I wonder if they go on still, those stories"

  "Oh, likely enough - with additions from the magazines, as I said. You
never heard, did you, of a real ghost at a private school? I thought not,
nobody has that ever I came across"

  "From the way in which you said that, I gather that you have"

  "I really don't know, but this is what was in my mind. It happened at my
private school thirty odd years ago, and I haven't any explanation of it.

  "The school I mean was near London. It was established in a large and
fairly old house - a great white building with very fine grounds about it;
there were large cedars in the garden, as there are in so many of the older
gardens in the Thames valley, and ancient elms in the three or four fields
which we used for our games. I think probably it was quite an attractive
place, but boys seldom allow that their schools possess any tolerable
features.

  "I came to the school in a September, soon after the year  and among
the boys who arrived on the same day was one whom I took to: a Highland boy,
whom I will call McLeod. I needn't spend time in describing him: the main
thing is that I got to know him very well. He was not an exceptional boy in
any way - not particularly good at books or games - but he suited me.

  "The school was a large one: there must have been from  boys
there as a rule, and so a considerable staff of masters was required, and
there were rather frequent changes among them.

  "One term - perhaps it was my third or fourth - a new master made his
appearance. His name was Sampson. He was a tallish, stoutish, pale,
black-bearded man. I think we liked him: he had travelled a good deal, and
had stories which amused us on our school walks, so that there was some
competition among us to get within earshot of him. I remember too - dear me,
I have hardly thought of it since then - that he had a charm on his
watch-chain that attracted my attention one day, and he let me examine it.
It was, I now suppose, a gold Byzantine coin; there was an effigy of some
absurd emperor on one side; the other side had been worn practically smooth,
and he had had cut on it - rather barbarously - his own initials,	
and a date, 24 July,  Yes, I can see it now: he told me he had picked
it up in Constantinople: it was about the size of a florin, perhaps rather
smaller.

  "Well, the first odd thing that happened was this. Sampson was doing
Latin grammar with us. One of his favourite methods - perhaps it is rather a
good one - was to make us construct sentences out of our own heads to
illustrate the rules he was trying to make us learn. Of course that is a
thing which gives a silly boy a chance of being impertinent: there are lots
of school stories in which that happens - or any-how there might be. But
Sampson was too good a disciplinarian for us to think of trying that on with
him. Now, on this occasion he was telling us how to express remembering in
Latin: and he ordered us each to make a sentence bringing in the verb
memini, 'I remember' Well, most of us made up some ordinary sentence such
as 'I remember my father, or 'He remembers his book' or something equally
uninteresting: and I dare say a good many put down memino librum meum, and
so forth: but the boy I mentioned - McLeod - was evidently thinking of
something more elaborate than that. The rest of us wanted to have our
sentences passed, and get on to something else, so some kicked him under the
desk, and I, who was next to him, poked him and whispered to him to look
sharp. But he didn't seem to attend. I looked at his paper and saw he had
put down nothing at all. So I jogged him again harder than before and
upbraided him sharply for keeping us all waiting. That did have some effect.
He started and seemed to wake up, and then very quickly he scribbled about a
couple of lines on his paper, and showed it up with the rest. As it was the
last, or nearly the last, to come in, and as Sampson had a good deal to say
to the boys who had written meminiscimus patri meo and the rest of it, it
turned out that the clock struck twelve before he had got to McLeod, and
McLeod had to wait afterwards to have his sentence corrected. There was
nothing much going on outside when I got out, so I waited for him to come.
He came very slowly when he did arrive, and I guessed there had been some
sort of trouble. 'Well,' I said, 'what did you get' 'Oh, I don't know'
said McLeod, 'nothing much: but I think Sampson's rather sick with me'
'Why, did you show him up some rot' 'No fear' he said. 'It was all right
as far as I could see: it was like this: Memento - that's right enough for
remember, and it takes a genitive, - memento putei inter quatuor taxos.'
'What silly rot' I said. 'What made you shove that down? What does it
mean' 'That's the funny part' said McLeod. not quite sure what it
does mean. All I know is, it just came into my head and I corked it down. I
know what I think it means, because just before I wrote it down I had a sort
of picture of it in my head: I believe it means "Remember the well among the
four" - what are those dark sort of trees that have red berries on them'
'Mountain ashes, I pose you mean' 'I never heard of them' said McLeod;
'no, I'll tell you - yews' 'Well, and what did Sampson say? 'Why, he was
jolly odd about it. When he read it he got up and went to the mantel-piece
and stopped quite a long time without saying anything, with his back to me.
And then he said, without turning round, and rather quiet, "What do you
suppose that means? I told him what I thought; only I couldn't remember the
name of the silly tree: and then he wanted to know why I put it down, and I
had to say something or other. And after that he left off talking about it,
and asked me how long I'd been here, and where my people lived, and things
like that: and then I came away: but he wasn't looking a bit well'

  "I don't remember any more that was said by either of us about this. Next
day McLeod took to his bed with a chill or something of the kind, and it was
a week or more before he was in school again. And as much as a month went by
without anything happening that was noticeable. Whether or not Mr. Sampson
was really startled, as McLeod had thought, he didn't show it. I am pretty
sure, of course, now, that there was something very curious in his past
history, but I'm not going to pretend that we boys were sharp enough to
guess any such thing.

  "There was one other incident of the same kind as the last which I told
you. Several times since that day we had had to make up examples in school
to illustrate different rules, but there had never been any row except when
we did them wrong. At last there came a day when we were going through those
dismal things which people call Conditional Sentences, and we were told to
make a conditional sentence, expressing a future consequence. We did it,
right or wrong, and showed up our bits of paper, and Sampson began looking
through them. All at once he got up, made some odd sort of noise in his
throat, and rushed out by a door that was just by his desk. We sat there for
a minute or two, and then - I suppose it was incorrect - but we went up, I
and one or two others, to look at the papers on his desk. Of course I
thought someone must have put down some nonsense or other, and Sampson had
gone off to report him. All the same, I noticed that he hadn't taken any of
the papers with him when he ran out. Well, the top paper on the desk was
written in red ink - which no one used - and it wasn't in anyone's hand who
was in the class. They all looked at it - McLeod and all - and took their
dying oaths that it wasn't theirs. Then I thought of counting the bits of
paper. And of this I made quite certain: that there were seventeen bits of
paper on the desk, and sixteen boys in the form. Well, I bagged the extra
paper, and kept it, and I believe I have it now. And now you will want to
know what was written on it. It was simple enough, and harmless enough, I
should have said.

  "Could you show me the paper" interrupted the listener.

  "Yes, I could: but there's another odd thing about it. That same
afternoon I took it out of my locker - I know for certain it was the same
bit, for I made a finger-mark on it and no single trace of writing of any
kind was there on it. I kept it, as I said, and since that time I have tried
various experiments to see whether sympathetic ink had been used, but
absolutely without result.

  "So much for that. After about half an hour Sampson looked in again: said
he had felt very unwell, and told us we might go. He came rather gingerly to
his desk, and gave just one look at the uppermost paper: and I suppose he
thought he must have been dreaming: anyhow, he asked no questions.

  "That day was a half-holiday, and next day Sampson was in school again,
much as usual. That night the third and last incident in my story happened.

  "We - McLeod and I - slept in a dormitory at right angles to the main
building. Sampson slept in the main building on the first floor. There was a
very bright full moon. At an hour which I can't tell exactly, but some time
between one and two, I was woken up by somebody shaking me. It was McLeod,
and a nice state of mind he seemed to be in. 'Come' he said, - 'come
there's a burglar getting in through Sampson's window' As soon as I could
speak, I said, 'Well, why not call out and wake everybody up? 'No, no' he
said, 'I'm not sure who it is: don't make a row: come and look' Naturally I
came and looked, and naturally there was no one there. I was cross enough,
and should have called McLeod plenty of names: only - I couldn't tell why -
it seemed to me that there was something wrong - something that made me very
glad I wasn't alone to face it. We were still at the window looking out, and
as soon as I could, I asked him what he had heard or seen. 'I didn't hear
anything at all' he said, 'but about five minutes before I woke you, I
found myself looking out of this window here, and there was a man sitting or
kneeling on Sampson's window-sill, and looking in, and I thought he was
beckoning' 'What sort of man' McLeod wriggled. 'I don't know' he said,
'but I can tell you one thing - he was beastly thin: and he looked as if he
was wet all over: and' he said, looking round and whispering as if he
hardly liked to hear himself, 'I'm not at all sure that he was alive'

  "We went on talking in whispers some time longer, and eventually crept
back to bed. No one else in the room woke or stirred the whole time. I
believe we did sleep a bit afterwards, but we were very cheap next day.

  "And next day Mr. Sampson was gone: not to be found: and I believe no
trace of him has ever come to light since. In thinking it over, one of the
oddest things about it all has seemed to me to be the fact that neither
McLeod nor I ever mentioned what we had seen to any third person whatever.
Of course no questions were asked on the subject, and if they had been, I am
inclined to believe that we could not have made any answer: we seemed unable
to speak about it.

  "That is my story" said the narrator. "The only approach to a ghost
story connected with a school that I know, but still, I think, an approach
to such a thing"

  The sequel to this may perhaps be reckoned highly conventional; but a
sequel there is, and so it must be produced. There had been more than one
listener to the story, and, in the latter part of that same year, or of the
next, one such listener was staying at a country house in Ireland.

  One evening his host was turning over a drawer full of odds and ends in
the smoking-room. Suddenly he put his hand upon a little box. "Now" he
said, "you know about old things; tell me what that is." My friend opened
the little box, and found in it a thin gold chain with an object attached to
it. He glanced at the object and then took off his spectacles to examine it
more narrowly. "What's the history of this" he asked. "Odd enough" was the
answer. "You know the yew thicket in the shrubbery: well, a year or two back
we were cleaning out the old well that used to be in the clearing here, and
what do you suppose we found"

  "Is it possible that you found a body? said the visitor, with an odd
feeling of nervousness.



Then the wolf was very angry indeed, and tried to get down the chimney in order to eat up the little pig. When the little pig saw what he was about, he put a pot full of water on the blazing fire, and, just as the wolf was coming down, he took off the cover, and in fell the wolf. Quickly the little pig clapped on the cover, and when the wolf was boiled ate him for supper.

said the wolf. As usual the little pig went off before the time, and got to the fair, and bought a butter-churn, which he was rolling home when he saw the wolf coming. So he got into the churn to hide, and in so doing turned it round, and it rolled down the hill with the pig in it, which frightened the wolf so much that he ran home without going to the fair. He went to the little pig's house, and told him how frightened he had been by a great round thing which came past him down the hill. Then the little pig said.
apples, hoping to get back before the wolf came; but it took long to climb the tree, and just as he was coming down from it, he saw the wolf coming. When the wolf came up he said
And he threw it so far that, while the wolf was gone to pick it up, the little pig jumped down and ran home. The next day the wolf came again, and said to the little pig
The little pig said: "Ready! I have been and come back again, and got a nice potful for dinner"
So he huffed, and he puffed, and he huffed, and he puffed, and he puffed and huffed; but he could NOT get the house down. Finding that he could not, with all his huffing and puffing, blow the house down, he said Once upon a time there were three little pigs, who went from home to seek their fortune. The first that went off met a man with a bundle of straw, and said to him The Story of the Three Little Pigs. 


Portrait Professional is the easiest and fastest way to re-touch portraits in just five easy steps, allowing you to achieve professional results in minutes.

Portrait Professional works in a completely different way to ordinary airbrushing and photo editing software normally used by the pros. Portrait Professional has been trained with hundreds of examples of human beauty, and as a result you can add as much or as little photo enhancement as required - by simply moving sliders. 

In fact due to the innate knowledge of human beauty built into Portrait Professional, the highest quality photo touch-up can be achieved by anyone in just a few minutes.

Portrait Professional is available in three editions, Standard, Studio and Studio64. All editions are covered by this manual.

Portrait Professional is available for Windows and Mac computers.  This manual is for the Windows version.
Click on the female or male button to let Portrait Professional know whether the face is a female or male face.

If the image is not the right way up, click on the orientation button that matches the orientation of your image to rotate your image. The orientation buttons are at the bottom of the controls panel.
Portrait Professional will guide you through each step but have a look at the quick start guide below to familiarize yourself with the stages.
The Adjust The Outline stage shouldn't take you very long.

You don't need to painstakingly position every point. In fact, you will get better results if you don't.

The only points that need to be accurately positioned are those around the eyes and mouth. For other points, if it is automatically placed in roughly the right place, resist the urge to make tiny changes to its position.
When adjusting the outline, move points as little as possible to get them to the right place.

For example, when moving the points around the mouth, or around the face, just move them in or out to get them on the perimeter. Try to avoid moving the points around the perimeter.

The exception is corner points. The points at the corners of the eyes, or the corners of the mouth must go in the right place.
Don't push the sliders up too far

Often, you can greatly improve a picture with fairly subtle changes.

Push the sliders up just far enough to get the results you want.

If you go too far, the result can look unnatural or faked.

Don't use the sliders to fix small blemishes
You can avoid the need to push the sliders up too far by using the Touch-Up tool to clean up spots and blemishes. This is better than pushing the sliders further up because that affects the whole face.

Make sure the skin area is right

Portrait Professional automatically works out which areas in your picture are skin. However, the automatic area selected can sometimes be adjusted to improve the results.

Use the skin Extend and Cut Back tools to paint over any skin areas that are wrong.
The Studio edition comes with a Photoshop plug-in component.  This allows you to open an image in Portrait Professional Studio directly from within Photoshop. When you have finished enhancing the image in Portrait Professional, the result is automatically loaded back into Photoshop.
Only the Studio edition can read RAW image files and Adobe DNG files. 
The Studio edition allows you to select multiple files using the file browser to set up a list of files to work through.  This speeds up your work-flow, since you can use a single command after enhancing each image to save the result and load the next one.
Enhancing skin only

If there is no face in the picture, press the Enhance Skin Only button.  When you press this button, you will then be asked to select the skin area by painting over it using brush tools.

This option is only intended to be used if you want to use the skin enhancing when there is no face in the picture.  If there is a face, you will get much better results if you select the gender and follow the usual steps to position the lines over the face.  This will also usually be quicker since the skin area will be automatically selected.

If the Enhance Skin Only button is not shown, you need to enable it using the Show "Enhance Skin Only" Button checkbox in the General Settings dialog.

Adjust the image orientation

If your image is not the right way up, click on one of the buttons at the bottom of the controls panel. This will rotate your image in the direction shown by the arrows.

Note that you need to change the orientation before selecting the gender, since Portrait Professional automatically advances to the next step when you select the gender.
Locating the feature points

In the controls panel you can see an example of which point you need to click on next, as an image and as a text description.

Click on the corresponding position in your image.

If you hold down the mouse button when clicking in your image, you can see a cross appear. You can then drag the mouse to reposition the cross.

The cross will have a small text label next to it to remind you which point you are locating. These labels can be turned off if you don't like them using the General Settings panel.

As soon as you release the mouse after clicking, Portrait Professional automatically asks you to select the next feature position.  However, if you want to adjust the positions of any of the points you have already located, you can click on them and drag them.

Profile views

If the face is viewed side on, press the Profile View button at the bottom of the control panel.

If you are not sure whether the face is being viewed in profile or not, the main test is whether you can see both eyes.  If you can't see one of the eyes due to the head being turned, press the Profile View button.

When you press the Profile View button, you will only need to locate one eye point, the nose tip, and one mouth point.
If you press the Skip button, you will go straight to the final stage where you can view the enhanced image.  However, some of the sliders (those that make changes that need the outline to be accurately placed) will not be available.

If you make any changes to the outline positions, the skip button will no longer be shown. You will then need to press the Next button instead, to go through the rest of the features as described below.

Note: if this button does not appear, make sure the option Show "Skip To Final Step" Button is checked on the General Settings dialog.  Also, once you start making any changes to the outline, the skip button becomes hidden.

Adjusting the outline
Adjusting the outline for each feature

Portrait Professional will take you to each of the features in turn so that you can check, and if necessary, adjust the positioning of the selected outline of each feature.

You should only need to spend a few seconds on this step as Portrait Professional does not need to have the positions marked completely accurately.  Generally the smaller the adjustments you make here, the better the results.
Once you have been through all the features, press the Next button one more time to start Portrait Professional processing your image. You will then be taken to the Enhance Image step, where the fun begins!

The features

The features are shown in the following order. 

Left eye and eyebrow

The left corner of the left eye is in the position you selected in the previous step, locating the main features.

You may want to adjust it now that the image is zoomed in more closely on the eye, along with the other points around the eye.

Two blue circles are shown inside the eye. The smaller circle should fit around the pupil (the black part in the middle of the eye). The larger circle should fit around the iris (the colored part of the eye). These circles are positioned automatically, so you will not usually need to adjust them. If they are in the wrong place, wait until the eye outline has been set before adjusting them since the circle positions may be fixed once the eye outline is correct.

If you do need to move the circles, click on the point in the center of the circles. This lets you reposition the circles.

If you click on the eye center point, two more points appear, one on each circle. These points let you adjust the sizes of the circles so that they fit around the pupil and iris respectively. The positions of these points around the circle don't matter, they are only used to set the sizes of the circles.

Depending on the shape of the eyebrow, it can be difficult to get the outline to fit around the eyebrow.  In these cases, it is best to not worry about it and just get the position roughly correct.  Even if you are able to get the outline to fit around the eyebrow reasonably well, if you had to move the points a lot to get it to fit, you may get a better result by moving the points less even if the eyebrow outline no longer goes around the eyebrow accurately.

Right eye and eyebrow

The same comments about the left eye and eyebrow apply to the right eye and eyebrow.

Nose and Mouth

When you get to this stage the Mouth Open Or Closed panel will appear, provided it has not been turned off in the General Settings. This panel has two buttons:
Press this button if the mouth of the face you are enhancing is open. You will then see four lines between the corners of the mouth. The top two should be positioned around the upper lip, and the bottom two around the lower lip. If the line along the bottom of the top lip is placed close to the line along the top of the bottom lip, you will see the line along the top of the bottom lip disappear leaving just the control point in the middle.  The mouth will then be treated as closed anyway.
you are used to pressing the spacebar to quickly move on to the next stage, note you can also use this to dismiss the dialog asking if the mouth is open or closed. If this happens, the mouth will be selected as being open. If the mouth is in fact shut, you can either press the Back button followed by the Next button, and the panel will appear again, or you can simply move the middle two lines together.
Face outline

The face outline does not need to be set accurately. The same rule applies here, that you will get the best results if you only move those points that need it, and move those as little as possible.

Try to avoid moving the face outline points around the face, just move them towards or away from the face.
After you have adjusted the outline around the face in your image, you are ready to start enhancing the image.

Viewing the result

You can choose whether you want to see the before and after image side by side, or whether you just want the enhanced image as large as possible. Use the tabs above the images to select which option you prefer.

Whichever option you use, you can always flip the enhanced after image back to the original to see the changes by pressing and holding the Enter key.

Changing the result

Portrait Professional will automatically enhance your image when you reach this stage. See Saved Sliders for how to configure this default enhancement.

You can change how the image is enhanced by moving the sliders in the Controls panel.

The sliders are grouped into sections that control various aspects of the face. When you first enter this stage, the Face Sculpt Controls and Skin Controls sections are open, and the others are closed. Sections can be opened or closed by clicking on their title button. This has a small triangle pointing down if the section is open, or right if the section is closed.

Try moving the Master Fade slider in each section to get an idea of the overall effect controlled by that section.

The lower sliders in each section give you finer control over the effect.

Portrait Professional also comes with a set of Saved Sliders settings, which set some or all of the sliders to pre-defined values to get a particular effect. You can go through these to see some of the types of enhancement possible for your photo.

Fixing problems

Most problems with the enhanced images are caused either by one or more sliders being pushed up too far, or by the skin or hair areas being wrong.

Use the Brush tools to fix the skin and hair areas.
When you select this command, the original image stored in the software is effectively replaced with the enhanced image you have just created. You are then taken back to the Select Gender stage so that you can go through the process again for another face in your image.

You can repeat this process as many times as you need until every face in the image has been enhanced.

IMPORTANT: Please note that when you select this command, the changes to enhance the current face are fixed. You will no longer be able to make changes to the way the current face is enhanced.

You therefore need to make sure you are completely finished with each face before moving on to the next one.
Portrait Professional is designed to enhance portrait photos.

However, if your photo includes other parts of the body, then you can use the skin enhancement tools on other parts of the skin that can be seen.

To do this, all you need to do is make sure that the Portrait Professional knows which parts of the photo are skin. This is done using the skin area tools, as described in Skin Area.

 
Examples of applications that can call Portrait Professional as a plug-in in this way are Adobe Photoshop, when using the Portrait Professional Photoshop plug-in, and Adobe Lightroom, when Portrait Professional has been set as the optional external editor.

 Internal format of RAR and ZIP archives created by WinRAR allows to store practically any number of files of practically any size. Actual limits depend on the file system and available memory. Some older file systems do not support files larger than 4 GB.

WinRAR allocates memory to store name and attributes of every archiving file. If quick open information is added, twice more memory is required to store file name and attributes. While concrete amount depends on a file name length in UTF-8 encoding, typically we can just add several hundred bytes per file to memory required for compression dictionary to estimate memory use when archiving. Also please take into account that 32 bit WinRAR cannot use more than 2 GB of memory. If you need to process a lot of files or use large dictionaries, 64 bit WinRAR may be preferable.


First, you need to run WinRAR. Double-click or press Enter on the WinRAR icon. You can also start it from the Windows "Start menu": enter "Programs" then "WinRAR" and then run the "WinRAR" item.

When WinRAR is running, it displays a list of files and folders in the current folder. You need to go to the folder, which contains files to archive. You may use Ctrl+D, the disks list below the toolbar or click on the small disk icon in the bottom left corner, to change the current disk. Press BS, Ctrl+PgUp, small "Up" button below the toolbar or double-click on the folder named  to go to the parent folder. Press Enter, Ctrl+PgDn or double-click on any other folder to enter that folder. Ctrl+\ will set the root disk or archive folder as the current folder.

When you have entered the folder with the desired files, select the files and folders, which you are going to archive. This may be achieved by using Shift + arrow keys or the mouse as in Windows Explorer and other Windows programs. It is also possible, in WinRAR, to select files using Space or Ins keys. keys on the numeric keypad allow the selection of groups of files using file masks.

Having selected one or more files, click on the Add button at the top of the WinRAR window, press Alt+A or select the "Add files to archive" command in the Commands menu. Enter the destination archive name in the dialog box which appears or simply accept the default name. You may select, in this dialog, the format of the new archive ( RAR or ZIP) compression level, volume size and other archiving parameters. This dialog described in details in Archive name and parameters dialog topic. Click on the OK button when you are ready to create the archive.

During the archiving process, a window will be displayed showing operation statistics. If you wish to break the archiving process, click on the Cancel button in the command window. You may press the "Background" button in this window to minimize WinRAR to the tray. When archiving is completed, the command window disappears and the newly created archive becomes the currently selected file.

It is also possible to add files, to an existing RAR archive, using drag-and-drop. Select the desired archive in the WinRAR window and press Enter (or double click) on its name. RAR will read the archive and display its contents. You may now add files to the archive by simply dragging them from another program and dropping to WinRAR.

Two men in a smoking-room were talking of their private-school days. "At our
school" said  "we had a ghost's footmark on the staircase. "

  " What was it like"

  "Oh, very unconvincing. Just the shape of a shoe, with a square toe, if I
remember right. The staircase was a stone one. I never heard any story about
the thing. That seems odd, when you come to think of it. Why didn't somebody
invent one, I wonder"

  "You never can tell with little boys. They have a mythology of their own.
There's a subject for you, by the way - "The Folklore of Private Schools"

  "Yes; the crop is rather scanty, though. I imagine, if you were to
investigate the cycle of ghost stories, for instance, which the boys at
private schools tell each other, they would all turn out to be
highly-compressed versions of stories out of books"

  "Nowadays the Strand and Pearson's, and so on, would be extensively drawn
upon"

  "No doubt: they weren't born or thought of in my time. Let's see. I
wonder if I can remember the staple ones that I was told. First, there was
the house with a room in which a series of people insisted on passing a
night; and each of them in the morning was found kneeling in a corner, and
had just time to say, 'I seen it' and died"

  "Wasn't that the house in Berkeley Square"

  "I dare say it was. Then there was the man who heard a noise in the
passage at night, opened his door, and saw someone crawling towards him on
all fours with his eye hanging out on his cheek. There was besides, let me
think - Yes! the room where a man was found dead in bed with a horseshoe
mark on his forehead, and the floor under the bed was covered with marks of
horseshoes also; I don't know why. Also there was the lady who, on locking
her bedroom door in a strange house, heard a thin voice among the
bed-curtains say, 'Now we're shut in for the night' None of those had any
explanation or sequel. I wonder if they go on still, those stories"

  "Oh, likely enough - with additions from the magazines, as I said. You
never heard, did you, of a real ghost at a private school? I thought not,
nobody has that ever I came across"

  "From the way in which you said that, I gather that you have"

  "I really don't know, but this is what was in my mind. It happened at my
private school thirty odd years ago, and I haven't any explanation of it.

  "The school I mean was near London. It was established in a large and
fairly old house - a great white building with very fine grounds about it;
there were large cedars in the garden, as there are in so many of the older
gardens in the Thames valley, and ancient elms in the three or four fields
which we used for our games. I think probably it was quite an attractive
place, but boys seldom allow that their schools possess any tolerable
features.

  "I came to the school in a September, soon after the year  and among
the boys who arrived on the same day was one whom I took to: a Highland boy,
whom I will call McLeod. I needn't spend time in describing him: the main
thing is that I got to know him very well. He was not an exceptional boy in
any way - not particularly good at books or games - but he suited me.

  "The school was a large one: there must have been from  boys
there as a rule, and so a considerable staff of masters was required, and
there were rather frequent changes among them.

  "One term - perhaps it was my third or fourth - a new master made his
appearance. His name was Sampson. He was a tallish, stoutish, pale,
black-bearded man. I think we liked him: he had travelled a good deal, and
had stories which amused us on our school walks, so that there was some
competition among us to get within earshot of him. I remember too - dear me,
I have hardly thought of it since then - that he had a charm on his
watch-chain that attracted my attention one day, and he let me examine it.
It was, I now suppose, a gold Byzantine coin; there was an effigy of some
absurd emperor on one side; the other side had been worn practically smooth,
and he had had cut on it - rather barbarously - his own initials,	
and a date, 24 July,  Yes, I can see it now: he told me he had picked
it up in Constantinople: it was about the size of a florin, perhaps rather
smaller.

  "Well, the first odd thing that happened was this. Sampson was doing
Latin grammar with us. One of his favourite methods - perhaps it is rather a
good one - was to make us construct sentences out of our own heads to
illustrate the rules he was trying to make us learn. Of course that is a
thing which gives a silly boy a chance of being impertinent: there are lots
of school stories in which that happens - or any-how there might be. But
Sampson was too good a disciplinarian for us to think of trying that on with
him. Now, on this occasion he was telling us how to express remembering in
Latin: and he ordered us each to make a sentence bringing in the verb
memini, 'I remember' Well, most of us made up some ordinary sentence such
as 'I remember my father, or 'He remembers his book' or something equally
uninteresting: and I dare say a good many put down memino librum meum, and
so forth: but the boy I mentioned - McLeod - was evidently thinking of
something more elaborate than that. The rest of us wanted to have our
sentences passed, and get on to something else, so some kicked him under the
desk, and I, who was next to him, poked him and whispered to him to look
sharp. But he didn't seem to attend. I looked at his paper and saw he had
put down nothing at all. So I jogged him again harder than before and
upbraided him sharply for keeping us all waiting. That did have some effect.
He started and seemed to wake up, and then very quickly he scribbled about a
couple of lines on his paper, and showed it up with the rest. As it was the
last, or nearly the last, to come in, and as Sampson had a good deal to say
to the boys who had written meminiscimus patri meo and the rest of it, it
turned out that the clock struck twelve before he had got to McLeod, and
McLeod had to wait afterwards to have his sentence corrected. There was
nothing much going on outside when I got out, so I waited for him to come.
He came very slowly when he did arrive, and I guessed there had been some
sort of trouble. 'Well,' I said, 'what did you get' 'Oh, I don't know'
said McLeod, 'nothing much: but I think Sampson's rather sick with me'
'Why, did you show him up some rot' 'No fear' he said. 'It was all right
as far as I could see: it was like this: Memento - that's right enough for
remember, and it takes a genitive, - memento putei inter quatuor taxos.'
'What silly rot' I said. 'What made you shove that down? What does it
mean' 'That's the funny part' said McLeod. not quite sure what it
does mean. All I know is, it just came into my head and I corked it down. I
know what I think it means, because just before I wrote it down I had a sort
of picture of it in my head: I believe it means "Remember the well among the
four" - what are those dark sort of trees that have red berries on them'
'Mountain ashes, I pose you mean' 'I never heard of them' said McLeod;
'no, I'll tell you - yews' 'Well, and what did Sampson say? 'Why, he was
jolly odd about it. When he read it he got up and went to the mantel-piece
and stopped quite a long time without saying anything, with his back to me.
And then he said, without turning round, and rather quiet, "What do you
suppose that means? I told him what I thought; only I couldn't remember the
name of the silly tree: and then he wanted to know why I put it down, and I
had to say something or other. And after that he left off talking about it,
and asked me how long I'd been here, and where my people lived, and things
like that: and then I came away: but he wasn't looking a bit well'

  "I don't remember any more that was said by either of us about this. Next
day McLeod took to his bed with a chill or something of the kind, and it was
a week or more before he was in school again. And as much as a month went by
without anything happening that was noticeable. Whether or not Mr. Sampson
was really startled, as McLeod had thought, he didn't show it. I am pretty
sure, of course, now, that there was something very curious in his past
history, but I'm not going to pretend that we boys were sharp enough to
guess any such thing.

  "There was one other incident of the same kind as the last which I told
you. Several times since that day we had had to make up examples in school
to illustrate different rules, but there had never been any row except when
we did them wrong. At last there came a day when we were going through those
dismal things which people call Conditional Sentences, and we were told to
make a conditional sentence, expressing a future consequence. We did it,
right or wrong, and showed up our bits of paper, and Sampson began looking
through them. All at once he got up, made some odd sort of noise in his
throat, and rushed out by a door that was just by his desk. We sat there for
a minute or two, and then - I suppose it was incorrect - but we went up, I
and one or two others, to look at the papers on his desk. Of course I
thought someone must have put down some nonsense or other, and Sampson had
gone off to report him. All the same, I noticed that he hadn't taken any of
the papers with him when he ran out. Well, the top paper on the desk was
written in red ink - which no one used - and it wasn't in anyone's hand who
was in the class. They all looked at it - McLeod and all - and took their
dying oaths that it wasn't theirs. Then I thought of counting the bits of
paper. And of this I made quite certain: that there were seventeen bits of
paper on the desk, and sixteen boys in the form. Well, I bagged the extra
paper, and kept it, and I believe I have it now. And now you will want to
know what was written on it. It was simple enough, and harmless enough, I
should have said.

  "Could you show me the paper" interrupted the listener.

  "Yes, I could: but there's another odd thing about it. That same
afternoon I took it out of my locker - I know for certain it was the same
bit, for I made a finger-mark on it and no single trace of writing of any
kind was there on it. I kept it, as I said, and since that time I have tried
various experiments to see whether sympathetic ink had been used, but
absolutely without result.

  "So much for that. After about half an hour Sampson looked in again: said
he had felt very unwell, and told us we might go. He came rather gingerly to
his desk, and gave just one look at the uppermost paper: and I suppose he
thought he must have been dreaming: anyhow, he asked no questions.

  "That day was a half-holiday, and next day Sampson was in school again,
much as usual. That night the third and last incident in my story happened.

  "We - McLeod and I - slept in a dormitory at right angles to the main
building. Sampson slept in the main building on the first floor. There was a
very bright full moon. At an hour which I can't tell exactly, but some time
between one and two, I was woken up by somebody shaking me. It was McLeod,
and a nice state of mind he seemed to be in. 'Come' he said, - 'come
there's a burglar getting in through Sampson's window' As soon as I could
speak, I said, 'Well, why not call out and wake everybody up? 'No, no' he
said, 'I'm not sure who it is: don't make a row: come and look' Naturally I
came and looked, and naturally there was no one there. I was cross enough,
and should have called McLeod plenty of names: only - I couldn't tell why -
it seemed to me that there was something wrong - something that made me very
glad I wasn't alone to face it. We were still at the window looking out, and
as soon as I could, I asked him what he had heard or seen. 'I didn't hear
anything at all' he said, 'but about five minutes before I woke you, I
found myself looking out of this window here, and there was a man sitting or
kneeling on Sampson's window-sill, and looking in, and I thought he was
beckoning' 'What sort of man' McLeod wriggled. 'I don't know' he said,
'but I can tell you one thing - he was beastly thin: and he looked as if he
was wet all over: and' he said, looking round and whispering as if he
hardly liked to hear himself, 'I'm not at all sure that he was alive'

  "We went on talking in whispers some time longer, and eventually crept
back to bed. No one else in the room woke or stirred the whole time. I
believe we did sleep a bit afterwards, but we were very cheap next day.

  "And next day Mr. Sampson was gone: not to be found: and I believe no
trace of him has ever come to light since. In thinking it over, one of the
oddest things about it all has seemed to me to be the fact that neither
McLeod nor I ever mentioned what we had seen to any third person whatever.
Of course no questions were asked on the subject, and if they had been, I am
inclined to believe that we could not have made any answer: we seemed unable
to speak about it.

  "That is my story" said the narrator. "The only approach to a ghost
story connected with a school that I know, but still, I think, an approach
to such a thing"

  The sequel to this may perhaps be reckoned highly conventional; but a
sequel there is, and so it must be produced. There had been more than one
listener to the story, and, in the latter part of that same year, or of the
next, one such listener was staying at a country house in Ireland.

  One evening his host was turning over a drawer full of odds and ends in
the smoking-room. Suddenly he put his hand upon a little box. "Now" he
said, "you know about old things; tell me what that is." My friend opened
the little box, and found in it a thin gold chain with an object attached to
it. He glanced at the object and then took off his spectacles to examine it
more narrowly. "What's the history of this" he asked. "Odd enough" was the
answer. "You know the yew thicket in the shrubbery: well, a year or two back
we were cleaning out the old well that used to be in the clearing here, and
what do you suppose we found"

  "Is it possible that you found a body? said the visitor, with an odd
feeling of nervousness.



Then the wolf was very angry indeed, and tried to get down the chimney in order to eat up the little pig. When the little pig saw what he was about, he put a pot full of water on the blazing fire, and, just as the wolf was coming down, he took off the cover, and in fell the wolf. Quickly the little pig clapped on the cover, and when the wolf was boiled ate him for supper.

said the wolf. As usual the little pig went off before the time, and got to the fair, and bought a butter-churn, which he was rolling home when he saw the wolf coming. So he got into the churn to hide, and in so doing turned it round, and it rolled down the hill with the pig in it, which frightened the wolf so much that he ran home without going to the fair. He went to the little pig's house, and told him how frightened he had been by a great round thing which came past him down the hill. Then the little pig said.
apples, hoping to get back before the wolf came; but it took long to climb the tree, and just as he was coming down from it, he saw the wolf coming. When the wolf came up he said
And he threw it so far that, while the wolf was gone to pick it up, the little pig jumped down and ran home. The next day the wolf came again, and said to the little pig
The little pig said: "Ready! I have been and come back again, and got a nice potful for dinner"
So he huffed, and he puffed, and he huffed, and he puffed, and he puffed and huffed; but he could NOT get the house down. Finding that he could not, with all his huffing and puffing, blow the house down, he said Once upon a time there were three little pigs, who went from home to seek their fortune. The first that went off met a man with a bundle of straw, and said to him The Story of the Three Little Pigs. 


Portrait Professional is the easiest and fastest way to re-touch portraits in just five easy steps, allowing you to achieve professional results in minutes.

Portrait Professional works in a completely different way to ordinary airbrushing and photo editing software normally used by the pros. Portrait Professional has been trained with hundreds of examples of human beauty, and as a result you can add as much or as little photo enhancement as required - by simply moving sliders. 

In fact due to the innate knowledge of human beauty built into Portrait Professional, the highest quality photo touch-up can be achieved by anyone in just a few minutes.

Portrait Professional is available in three editions, Standard, Studio and Studio64. All editions are covered by this manual.

Portrait Professional is available for Windows and Mac computers.  This manual is for the Windows version.
Click on the female or male button to let Portrait Professional know whether the face is a female or male face.

If the image is not the right way up, click on the orientation button that matches the orientation of your image to rotate your image. The orientation buttons are at the bottom of the controls panel.
Portrait Professional will guide you through each step but have a look at the quick start guide below to familiarize yourself with the stages.
The Adjust The Outline stage shouldn't take you very long.

You don't need to painstakingly position every point. In fact, you will get better results if you don't.

The only points that need to be accurately positioned are those around the eyes and mouth. For other points, if it is automatically placed in roughly the right place, resist the urge to make tiny changes to its position.
When adjusting the outline, move points as little as possible to get them to the right place.

For example, when moving the points around the mouth, or around the face, just move them in or out to get them on the perimeter. Try to avoid moving the points around the perimeter.

The exception is corner points. The points at the corners of the eyes, or the corners of the mouth must go in the right place.
Don't push the sliders up too far

Often, you can greatly improve a picture with fairly subtle changes.

Push the sliders up just far enough to get the results you want.

If you go too far, the result can look unnatural or faked.

Don't use the sliders to fix small blemishes
You can avoid the need to push the sliders up too far by using the Touch-Up tool to clean up spots and blemishes. This is better than pushing the sliders further up because that affects the whole face.

Make sure the skin area is right

Portrait Professional automatically works out which areas in your picture are skin. However, the automatic area selected can sometimes be adjusted to improve the results.

Use the skin Extend and Cut Back tools to paint over any skin areas that are wrong.
The Studio edition comes with a Photoshop plug-in component.  This allows you to open an image in Portrait Professional Studio directly from within Photoshop. When you have finished enhancing the image in Portrait Professional, the result is automatically loaded back into Photoshop.
Only the Studio edition can read RAW image files and Adobe DNG files. 
The Studio edition allows you to select multiple files using the file browser to set up a list of files to work through.  This speeds up your work-flow, since you can use a single command after enhancing each image to save the result and load the next one.
Enhancing skin only

If there is no face in the picture, press the Enhance Skin Only button.  When you press this button, you will then be asked to select the skin area by painting over it using brush tools.

This option is only intended to be used if you want to use the skin enhancing when there is no face in the picture.  If there is a face, you will get much better results if you select the gender and follow the usual steps to position the lines over the face.  This will also usually be quicker since the skin area will be automatically selected.

If the Enhance Skin Only button is not shown, you need to enable it using the Show "Enhance Skin Only" Button checkbox in the General Settings dialog.

Adjust the image orientation

If your image is not the right way up, click on one of the buttons at the bottom of the controls panel. This will rotate your image in the direction shown by the arrows.

Note that you need to change the orientation before selecting the gender, since Portrait Professional automatically advances to the next step when you select the gender.
Locating the feature points

In the controls panel you can see an example of which point you need to click on next, as an image and as a text description.

Click on the corresponding position in your image.

If you hold down the mouse button when clicking in your image, you can see a cross appear. You can then drag the mouse to reposition the cross.

The cross will have a small text label next to it to remind you which point you are locating. These labels can be turned off if you don't like them using the General Settings panel.

As soon as you release the mouse after clicking, Portrait Professional automatically asks you to select the next feature position.  However, if you want to adjust the positions of any of the points you have already located, you can click on them and drag them.

Profile views

If the face is viewed side on, press the Profile View button at the bottom of the control panel.

If you are not sure whether the face is being viewed in profile or not, the main test is whether you can see both eyes.  If you can't see one of the eyes due to the head being turned, press the Profile View button.

When you press the Profile View button, you will only need to locate one eye point, the nose tip, and one mouth point.
If you press the Skip button, you will go straight to the final stage where you can view the enhanced image.  However, some of the sliders (those that make changes that need the outline to be accurately placed) will not be available.

If you make any changes to the outline positions, the skip button will no longer be shown. You will then need to press the Next button instead, to go through the rest of the features as described below.

Note: if this button does not appear, make sure the option Show "Skip To Final Step" Button is checked on the General Settings dialog.  Also, once you start making any changes to the outline, the skip button becomes hidden.

Adjusting the outline
Adjusting the outline for each feature

Portrait Professional will take you to each of the features in turn so that you can check, and if necessary, adjust the positioning of the selected outline of each feature.

You should only need to spend a few seconds on this step as Portrait Professional does not need to have the positions marked completely accurately.  Generally the smaller the adjustments you make here, the better the results.
Once you have been through all the features, press the Next button one more time to start Portrait Professional processing your image. You will then be taken to the Enhance Image step, where the fun begins!

The features

The features are shown in the following order. 

Left eye and eyebrow

The left corner of the left eye is in the position you selected in the previous step, locating the main features.

You may want to adjust it now that the image is zoomed in more closely on the eye, along with the other points around the eye.

Two blue circles are shown inside the eye. The smaller circle should fit around the pupil (the black part in the middle of the eye). The larger circle should fit around the iris (the colored part of the eye). These circles are positioned automatically, so you will not usually need to adjust them. If they are in the wrong place, wait until the eye outline has been set before adjusting them since the circle positions may be fixed once the eye outline is correct.

If you do need to move the circles, click on the point in the center of the circles. This lets you reposition the circles.

If you click on the eye center point, two more points appear, one on each circle. These points let you adjust the sizes of the circles so that they fit around the pupil and iris respectively. The positions of these points around the circle don't matter, they are only used to set the sizes of the circles.

Depending on the shape of the eyebrow, it can be difficult to get the outline to fit around the eyebrow.  In these cases, it is best to not worry about it and just get the position roughly correct.  Even if you are able to get the outline to fit around the eyebrow reasonably well, if you had to move the points a lot to get it to fit, you may get a better result by moving the points less even if the eyebrow outline no longer goes around the eyebrow accurately.

Right eye and eyebrow

The same comments about the left eye and eyebrow apply to the right eye and eyebrow.

Nose and Mouth

When you get to this stage the Mouth Open Or Closed panel will appear, provided it has not been turned off in the General Settings. This panel has two buttons:
Press this button if the mouth of the face you are enhancing is open. You will then see four lines between the corners of the mouth. The top two should be positioned around the upper lip, and the bottom two around the lower lip. If the line along the bottom of the top lip is placed close to the line along the top of the bottom lip, you will see the line along the top of the bottom lip disappear leaving just the control point in the middle.  The mouth will then be treated as closed anyway.
you are used to pressing the spacebar to quickly move on to the next stage, note you can also use this to dismiss the dialog asking if the mouth is open or closed. If this happens, the mouth will be selected as being open. If the mouth is in fact shut, you can either press the Back button followed by the Next button, and the panel will appear again, or you can simply move the middle two lines together.
Face outline

The face outline does not need to be set accurately. The same rule applies here, that you will get the best results if you only move those points that need it, and move those as little as possible.

Try to avoid moving the face outline points around the face, just move them towards or away from the face.
After you have adjusted the outline around the face in your image, you are ready to start enhancing the image.

Viewing the result

You can choose whether you want to see the before and after image side by side, or whether you just want the enhanced image as large as possible. Use the tabs above the images to select which option you prefer.

Whichever option you use, you can always flip the enhanced after image back to the original to see the changes by pressing and holding the Enter key.

Changing the result

Portrait Professional will automatically enhance your image when you reach this stage. See Saved Sliders for how to configure this default enhancement.

You can change how the image is enhanced by moving the sliders in the Controls panel.

The sliders are grouped into sections that control various aspects of the face. When you first enter this stage, the Face Sculpt Controls and Skin Controls sections are open, and the others are closed. Sections can be opened or closed by clicking on their title button. This has a small triangle pointing down if the section is open, or right if the section is closed.

Try moving the Master Fade slider in each section to get an idea of the overall effect controlled by that section.

The lower sliders in each section give you finer control over the effect.

Portrait Professional also comes with a set of Saved Sliders settings, which set some or all of the sliders to pre-defined values to get a particular effect. You can go through these to see some of the types of enhancement possible for your photo.

Fixing problems

Most problems with the enhanced images are caused either by one or more sliders being pushed up too far, or by the skin or hair areas being wrong.

Use the Brush tools to fix the skin and hair areas.
When you select this command, the original image stored in the software is effectively replaced with the enhanced image you have just created. You are then taken back to the Select Gender stage so that you can go through the process again for another face in your image.

You can repeat this process as many times as you need until every face in the image has been enhanced.

IMPORTANT: Please note that when you select this command, the changes to enhance the current face are fixed. You will no longer be able to make changes to the way the current face is enhanced.

You therefore need to make sure you are completely finished with each face before moving on to the next one.
Portrait Professional is designed to enhance portrait photos.

However, if your photo includes other parts of the body, then you can use the skin enhancement tools on other parts of the skin that can be seen.

To do this, all you need to do is make sure that the Portrait Professional knows which parts of the photo are skin. This is done using the skin area tools, as described in Skin Area.

 
Examples of applications that can call Portrait Professional as a plug-in in this way are Adobe Photoshop, when using the Portrait Professional Photoshop plug-in, and Adobe Lightroom, when Portrait Professional has been set as the optional external editor.

 Internal format of RAR and ZIP archives created by WinRAR allows to store practically any number of files of practically any size. Actual limits depend on the file system and available memory. Some older file systems do not support files larger than 4 GB.

WinRAR allocates memory to store name and attributes of every archiving file. If quick open information is added, twice more memory is required to store file name and attributes. While concrete amount depends on a file name length in UTF-8 encoding, typically we can just add several hundred bytes per file to memory required for compression dictionary to estimate memory use when archiving. Also please take into account that 32 bit WinRAR cannot use more than 2 GB of memory. If you need to process a lot of files or use large dictionaries, 64 bit WinRAR may be preferable.


First, you need to run WinRAR. Double-click or press Enter on the WinRAR icon. You can also start it from the Windows "Start menu": enter "Programs" then "WinRAR" and then run the "WinRAR" item.

When WinRAR is running, it displays a list of files and folders in the current folder. You need to go to the folder, which contains files to archive. You may use Ctrl+D, the disks list below the toolbar or click on the small disk icon in the bottom left corner, to change the current disk. Press BS, Ctrl+PgUp, small "Up" button below the toolbar or double-click on the folder named  to go to the parent folder. Press Enter, Ctrl+PgDn or double-click on any other folder to enter that folder. Ctrl+\ will set the root disk or archive folder as the current folder.

When you have entered the folder with the desired files, select the files and folders, which you are going to archive. This may be achieved by using Shift + arrow keys or the mouse as in Windows Explorer and other Windows programs. It is also possible, in WinRAR, to select files using Space or Ins keys. keys on the numeric keypad allow the selection of groups of files using file masks.

Having selected one or more files, click on the Add button at the top of the WinRAR window, press Alt+A or select the "Add files to archive" command in the Commands menu. Enter the destination archive name in the dialog box which appears or simply accept the default name. You may select, in this dialog, the format of the new archive ( RAR or ZIP) compression level, volume size and other archiving parameters. This dialog described in details in Archive name and parameters dialog topic. Click on the OK button when you are ready to create the archive.

During the archiving process, a window will be displayed showing operation statistics. If you wish to break the archiving process, click on the Cancel button in the command window. You may press the "Background" button in this window to minimize WinRAR to the tray. When archiving is completed, the command window disappears and the newly created archive becomes the currently selected file.

It is also possible to add files, to an existing RAR archive, using drag-and-drop. Select the desired archive in the WinRAR window and press Enter (or double click) on its name. RAR will read the archive and display its contents. You may now add files to the archive by simply dragging them from another program and dropping to WinRAR.
